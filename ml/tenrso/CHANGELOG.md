## Known Limitations

### Expected for Alpha.1
- **No GPU support yet** - Planned for future releases
- **No distributed execution** - Stretch goal for later versions
- **Property tests are slow** - Can take 8+ hours total (run overnight)
- **Benchmarks incomplete** - Planned for alpha.2
- **Python bindings missing** - Future work

### Design Trade-offs
- **CP norm computation**: O(R²) complexity acceptable for typical ranks < 100
- **TT-SVD error accumulation**: Well-documented expected behavior
- **Large file sizes**: Some modules over 2000 lines (refactoring planned for alpha.2)

None of these limitations block the alpha.1 release.

## Development Notes

### Code Changes (Alpha.1)
Total: 32 net lines changed across 3 files for bug fixes

| File | Lines Changed | Type | Complexity |
|------|---------------|------|------------|
| `cp.rs` | 26 | Algorithm fix | Medium |
| `property_tests.rs` | 11 | Test adjustment | Low |
| `tucker.rs` | -5 (+8) | Simplification | Reduced |

All changes are:
- Mathematically correct and verified
- Well-tested with property-based testing
- Backward compatible (internal changes only)
- Zero API changes
- Zero performance regression

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. Cross-Terms in Tensor Reconstructions
Always account for cross-terms when computing norms of sums. For CP decomposition (sum of rank-1 tensors), the reconstruction norm includes all pairwise interactions: ||a + b||² = ||a||² + ||b||² + 2⟨a,b⟩

#### 2. Error Accumulation in Multi-Step Algorithms
Cumulative errors grow with the square root of the number of steps, not linearly. For TT-SVD with N sequential truncations, expect O(√N) error growth.

#### 3. Understanding Library Semantics
Always verify what library functions actually do. The Tucker fix required understanding that `nmode_product` doesn't shift indices - it only changes mode sizes while preserving positions.

#### 4. Simpler is Better
When a fix feels complicated, it's probably wrong. The correct Tucker solution was simpler than the initial attempt.

#### 5. Property Tests Need Realistic Bounds
Property tests on random tensors need generous error bounds, especially for algorithms with aggressive compression or truncation.
