## Streaming MTTKRP - COMPLETE

Closes `crates/tenrso-kernels/TODO.md` "Out-of-core MTTKRP (future M5)". The kernel math
lives in `tenrso-kernels`; the chunking, streaming and memory bound live here.

- [x] `chunk_source.rs`: `ChunkSource` trait + row-major sub-box extraction (`copy_subbox`)
  - [x] `DenseChunkSource` (RAM), `MmapChunkSource` (mmap'd file), `ArrowChunkStore`
        (Arrow IPC, one record batch per chunk, random access via the file footer)
  - [x] `ArrowReader::num_batches` / `read_batch` (random-access batch decode)
- [x] `mttkrp_stream.rs`: `StreamingMttkrp`, `MttkrpAccumulator`, `MttkrpStreamPlan`
  - [x] Single-mode streaming MTTKRP
  - [x] **All modes in one disk pass** (a full CP-ALS sweep costs 1 pass, not N),
        using the dimension-tree kernel per chunk (~2·nnz·R vs N·nnz·R multiply-adds)
  - [x] Global index offsets on both sides: factor rows sliced to `A_k[s_k..e_k, :]`,
        partials accumulated into `M_n[s_n..e_n, :]`
  - [x] Hard, configurable memory bound; the window size is *derived* from the budget,
        and a budget that cannot hold one chunk is a loud error
  - [x] Back-pressure + peak accounting via `MemoryManager`
        (`can_fit` / `get_chunk` / `release_chunk` / `peak_memory`)
  - [x] Deterministic accumulation: ascending chunk-linear order, never completion order;
        bit-identical across thread count, window size, and budget
- [x] Tests: 16 integration (`tests/mttkrp_streaming.rs`) + 12 unit
  - [x] 3rd/4th order, non-cubic, ranks 1..12, every mode
  - [x] Ragged final chunks; chunk size 1; chunk size == whole tensor; chunk > dim
  - [x] Real on-disk paths (mmap binary + Arrow chunk store) in `std::env::temp_dir()`
  - [x] Bitwise determinism across execution schedules; bounded-memory assertions
- [x] Benchmarks: `benches/mttkrp_stream.rs`; example: `examples/mttkrp_streaming.rs`

### Follow-ups

- Double-buffered prefetch (fetch window `w+1` while computing window `w`) — the current
  loop serializes I/O and compute per window.
- Sparse out-of-core MTTKRP (stream COO/CSF blocks; the accumulation math is unchanged).
- A `ChunkSource` over Parquet row groups (needs row-group-aligned writes; the Arrow IPC
  store already gives the columnar on-disk path).

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-RC.1)

- CUDA/ROCm/Vulkan/Metal GPU backends (currently CPU fallback only)
- Distributed storage integration (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Apache Arrow Flight for high-performance distributed data
- Advanced compression algorithms (Brotli, Snappy)
