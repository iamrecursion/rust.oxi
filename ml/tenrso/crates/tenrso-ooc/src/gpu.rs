//! GPU abstraction layer for tensor operations
//!
//! This module provides a device-agnostic interface for GPU-accelerated tensor operations
//! with CPU fallback. It supports:
//! - Unified device buffer management (CPU/GPU)
//! - Asynchronous memory transfers
//! - Multi-device support
//! - Automatic device selection
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The abstraction is backend-agnostic and, via `scirs2-core`'s GPU abstraction
//! (`scirs2_core::gpu`), can enumerate real hardware for:
//! - CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs), behind the optional `cuda` feature
//! - ROCm (AMD GPUs), behind the optional `rocm` feature
//! - Metal (Apple Silicon), behind the optional `metal` feature
//! - Vulkan / cross-platform GPU compute (via `wgpu`), behind the optional `vulkan` feature
//!
//! All four are default-off: a plain `cargo build` never links a vendor SDK and
//! never attempts hardware probing.
//!
//! # Current Implementation
//!
//! By default, buffer operations (`DeviceBuffer`, `Device::add`, `Device::mul`,
//! ...) execute on the CPU in this crate; GPU *devices* can be enumerated (see
//! [`DeviceManager::available_backends`]) but tensor kernels are not dispatched
//! to them. Device buffer/compute operations:
//! - Run on the CPU regardless of which backends were detected
//! - Support async transfers using thread pools
//! - Provide the same API that GPU-dispatching backends use
//!
//! ## Real GPU dispatch (`cuda-compute` feature, default-off)
//!
//! When the optional `cuda-compute` feature is enabled, [`Device::add`] and
//! [`Device::mul`] for `f32` / `f64` on a [`DeviceType::Cuda`] device run the
//! arithmetic on an actual NVIDIA GPU via the pure-Rust `oxicuda` crates (see
//! [`crate::gpu_cuda`]). Because [`DeviceBuffer`] is host-backed (`data: Vec<T>`),
//! each such op is a full host->device->host round-trip: for a single
//! element-wise op the PCIe transfer dominates, so this is a
//! **correctness / capability path, NOT a speedup** for lone host-buffer ops.
//! Persistent on-device residency (which is where a real speedup would come
//! from) is a future milestone. Without the feature, every code path below is
//! exactly the CPU implementation.
//!
//! Device *enumeration* is honest: a device only appears in
//! [`DeviceManager::list_devices`] if its backend's cargo feature was compiled
//! in **and** `scirs2-core` actually queried real hardware for it. When a
//! backend's feature is off, or the feature is on but no hardware is found,
//! [`DeviceManager::available_backends`] reports that truthfully instead of
//! silently looking identical to "we never checked".
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use tenrso_ooc::gpu::{DeviceManager, DeviceType, DeviceBuffer};
//!
//! // Get device manager
//! let manager = DeviceManager::new()?;
//!
//! // Select best device (CPU fallback if no GPU)
//! let device = manager.best_device()?;
//!
//! // Allocate buffer on device
//! let mut buffer = device.allocate::<f64>(1024)?;
//!
//! // Copy data to device
//! let data = vec![1.0; 1024];
//! buffer.copy_from_host(&data)?;
//!
//! // Perform operations on device
//! // ...
//!
//! // Copy result back
//! let result = buffer.copy_to_host()?;
//! ```
