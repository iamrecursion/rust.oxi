/// implementations of one algorithm. They converge to the same class of stationary
/// points but do *not* produce the same iterates, may need a different number of
/// sweeps, and can land on different local optima from the same initialization.
///
/// [`cp_als`](crate::cp_als) is hard-wired to [`UpdateScheme::GaussSeidel`]; use
/// [`cp_als_with_scheme`](crate::cp_als_with_scheme) to opt into anything else.
///
/// # Which should I use?
///
/// **`GaussSeidel` — the default, and almost certainly what you want.** It is
/// classical ALS (Kolda & Bader 2009) and it is *not* the slow choice here: TenRSo
/// runs it on a dimension tree whose partial contractions are shared across the
/// whole sweep *without* breaking the sequential dependency (see
/// `cp::dimtree`), so a sweep costs `2·nnz·R` — the same as Jacobi — and the fit
/// comes for free out of the sweep's last MTTKRP.
///
/// **`Jacobi` — opt in only if you know why.** Its one structural advantage is that
/// all `N` mode updates of a sweep are mutually independent, so they can be
/// dispatched concurrently or onto separate devices. In a single process that buys
/// nothing here, and it costs you on three fronts:
///
/// * **it needs stabilizing to converge at all** (see below);
/// * an extra `nnz·R` MTTKRP per sweep, because after a Jacobi sweep every factor is
///   new and no sweep intermediate can supply `⟨X, [[A]]⟩` for the fit;
/// * fewer effective updates per sweep — every mode is solved against stale
///   partners — so it needs *more* sweeps to reach a given fit.
///
/// # The stabilization, and why it is mandatory
///
/// The naked simultaneous update `A_k ← M_k G_k^{-1}` for every `k` at once — what
/// you get by dropping an all-modes MTTKRP kernel straight into an ALS loop —
/// **diverges**. In the rank-1 case with `A_k = α_k a_k` and `p = Π_k α_k`, the exact
/// per-mode solve gives `α_k' = α_k / p`, so `p' = p^{1-N}`; linearizing about the
/// correct fixed point `p = 1` gives `p' ≈ 1 - (N-1)ε`. **The reconstruction-scale
/// error is amplified by `N-1` every sweep** and flips sign: 2× per sweep for a
/// 3-way tensor, 3× for a 4-way one. Measured on an exact rank-3 `8×8×8` tensor, the
/// naked iteration's fit collapses to 0 within four sweeps while Gauss-Seidel
/// reaches 1.0.
///
/// `Jacobi` therefore ships *stabilized*: each sweep normalizes every factor column
/// to unit norm and then **solves** for the `R` component weights
/// (`λ = H⁻¹g`, the exact least-squares minimizer over the scale subspace) instead of
/// letting them compound. That removes the unstable direction and the iteration
/// converges. It is still a different algorithm from `GaussSeidel`, with a different
/// iterate sequence, a different sweep count, and potentially a different local
