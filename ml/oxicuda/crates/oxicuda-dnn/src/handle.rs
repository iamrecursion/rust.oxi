//! DNN handle management.
//!
//! [`DnnHandle`] is the central object for all DNN operations, analogous to
//! `cudnnHandle_t` in cuDNN.  It owns a CUDA stream, a [`BlasHandle`] for
//! matrix operations, a `KernelCache` of JIT-compiled kernels, a
//! [`PtxCache`] of generated PTX text on disk, and an optional workspace
//! buffer.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use std::sync::Arc;
//! # use oxicuda_driver::Context;
//! # use oxicuda_dnn::handle::DnnHandle;
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), oxicuda_dnn::error::DnnError> {
//! # let ctx: Arc<Context> = unimplemented!();
//! let mut handle = DnnHandle::new(&ctx)?;
//! handle.set_workspace(1 << 20)?; // 1 MiB workspace
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
