//! Device-presence assertion, gated behind the `gpu-tests` Cargo feature.
//!
//! Every GPU-path test elsewhere in this crate (and in `oxicuda-webgpu`)
//! degrades gracefully to a no-op skip when no device is available, so the
//! suite stays green on headless CI. That portability has a real cost: if
//! [`MetalDevice::new`] silently starts failing (a regression in device
//! selection, a driver change, a broken CI image), every one of those tests
//! keeps reporting PASS while genuinely executing nothing on a GPU.
//!
//! This file closes that hole with the opposite policy: **when the
//! `gpu-tests` feature is enabled, the absence of a real Metal device is a
//! hard test failure, not a skip.** Run it explicitly on a machine that is
//! known to have a Metal-capable GPU:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo nextest run -p oxicuda-metal --features gpu-tests
//! ```
//!
//! The whole file is `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]` in addition to the
//! feature gate: off macOS, `MetalDevice::new()` always returns
//! `MetalError::UnsupportedPlatform` by design (see `oxicuda_metal::device`),
//! so demanding a live device there would fail for a reason that has nothing
//! to do with GPU availability. A workspace-wide `--all-features` run on
//! Linux therefore stays green; the hard-failure guarantee applies on the
//! platform this crate actually targets.
//!
//! This is a *compile-time feature* deliberately distinct from the
//! `OXICUDA_REQUIRE_GPU=1` *runtime* env-var switch used by the crate's
//! in-tree `#[cfg(test)]` suites (see `src/backend/gpu_tests.rs`). The two
//! are complementary: the env var flips the behaviour of tests that already
//! exist and run by default, while this feature adds a test that exists
//! *only* when explicitly opted into — a CI job can enable `gpu-tests` on a
//! GPU runner without needing to also thread an environment variable through.
