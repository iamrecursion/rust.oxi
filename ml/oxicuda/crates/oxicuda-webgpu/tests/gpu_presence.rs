//! Device-presence assertion, gated behind the `gpu-tests` Cargo feature.
//!
//! Mirrors `oxicuda-metal/tests/gpu_presence.rs`. Every GPU-path test
//! elsewhere in this crate degrades gracefully to a no-op skip when no wgpu
//! adapter is available, so the suite stays green on headless CI. That
//! portability has a real cost: if [`WebGpuDevice::new`] silently starts
//! failing (a regression in adapter selection, a driver change, a broken CI
//! image), every one of those tests keeps reporting PASS while genuinely
//! executing nothing on a GPU.
//!
//! This file closes that hole with the opposite policy: **when the
//! `gpu-tests` feature is enabled, the absence of a real wgpu adapter is a
//! hard test failure, not a skip.** Run it explicitly on a machine that is
//! known to have a GPU wgpu can drive (Metal on macOS, Vulkan/DX12 on
//! Linux/Windows):
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo nextest run -p oxicuda-webgpu --features gpu-tests
//! ```
//!
//! Unlike the `oxicuda-metal` counterpart, this file is **not** further
//! gated by `target_os`: `wgpu` targets Vulkan, Metal, and DX12 across every
//! desktop platform, so there is no platform on which `--features
//! gpu-tests` is expected to compile but never find an adapter — enabling
//! the feature is itself the opt-in to "this environment must have a GPU".
//!
//! # A GPU is not sufficient on Linux: the loader must be installed too
//!
//! wgpu reaches an NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPU through the **Vulkan loader**
//! (`libvulkan.so.1`), not through the vendor driver directly. A box can have
//! a perfectly good GPU, a working CUDA stack, and even the vendor's Vulkan
//! ICD manifest in `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/` and still fail here: with no
//! loader installed, wgpu enumerates only its OpenGL fallback adapter, whose
//! `request_device` fails with "Parent device is lost". `WebGpuDevice::new`
//! appends the adapter's backend to that message precisely so this case is
//! recognisable — a reported `backend Gl` on a machine with a discrete GPU
//! means the loader is missing (`apt install libvulkan1`), not that the
//! hardware is absent.
//!
//! This is a *compile-time feature* deliberately distinct from the
//! `OXICUDA_REQUIRE_GPU=1` *runtime* env-var switch used by the crate's
//! in-tree `#[cfg(test)]` suites (see `src/backend_tests.rs`). The two are
//! complementary: the env var flips the behaviour of tests that already
//! exist and run by default, while this feature adds a test that exists
//! *only* when explicitly opted into.
