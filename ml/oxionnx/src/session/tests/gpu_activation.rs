//! End-to-end checks for run-scoped activation residency.
//!
//! Two claims, both device-backed, both skipped (loudly) on a machine with no
//! adapter:
//!
//! * **Bit identity.** Turning residency on changes where a value lives, never
//!   what it is. A `Conv -> Relu -> Conv -> Add` chain run both ways must
//!   produce the same `Vec<f32>`, compared exactly.
//! * **Less traffic.** The same chain must move strictly fewer bytes across the
//!   bus with residency on — otherwise the mechanism is bookkeeping.
//!
//! Plus the lifetime claim: when the run ends, every activation's buffer is
//! gone and the context's live-byte total is back at its resident-weight
//! baseline.
//!
//! # Why these chains
//!
//! The ops are chosen so that "same value" and "same bits" are the same
//! statement. `Conv` runs the identical implicit-GEMM kernel in both regimes,
//! so its accumulation order cannot change. `Add`, `Mul` and `LeakyRelu` are
//! promoted from the CPU to the GPU by residency — a real placement change —
//! but `select(alpha*x, x, x >= 0)`, IEEE-754 addition and IEEE-754
//! multiplication are exact and order-free, so both sides agree to the bit.
//!
//! Two graphs, because the optimizer folds one of them. `Conv -> Relu -> Conv
//! -> Add` is the mandated chain, and the Conv+Relu fusion pass
//! (`optimizer::fusion::conv::relu`) folds its `Relu` into the first
//! convolution's epilogue before the run loop ever sees it — so what executes
//! is `Conv(relu) -> Conv -> Add`, which exercises a resident convolution
//! result and a promoted binary operand but no standalone element-wise node.
//! [`a_standalone_elementwise_node_reaches_the_gpu_only_when_resident`] covers
//! that separately with `LeakyRelu`, which no fusion pass claims — and which is
//! the shape InSwapper's 57 memory-bound nodes actually have.
//!
//! That is a property of these ops, **not** of residency in general. Promoting
//! a reduction-based op (`OxiInstanceNorm`, `Softmax`, `LayerNorm`,
//! `ReduceMean`) from the CPU to the GPU changes the summation order and
//! therefore the low bits of the result — correct, but not identical. A chain
//! containing one belongs in a tolerance test, not this one.
