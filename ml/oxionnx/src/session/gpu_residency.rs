//! Residency-aware placement and run statistics for
//! [`crate::Session::run_gpu_async`].
//!
//! # What is here, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! This module holds the two things that turned out to matter, both keyed by
//! concepts the session owns and `oxionnx-gpu` deliberately knows nothing
//! about (it takes slices, never tensor names or `OpKind`s):
//!
//! * [`gpu_min_transfer_elements`] — the **two-tier size gate**. Its two
//!   tiers, [`ResidencyTier::Transferred`] and [`ResidencyTier::Resident`],
//!   are two different cost models, and the gap between them is the measured,
//!   quantitative case for building tensor residency at all.
//! * [`GpuRunStats`] — per-run counters (nodes on GPU vs CPU, read-backs and
//!   their bytes, CPU fallback time by op type). These are what the wave's
//!   measurement table is built from; nothing else in the engine records
//!   which provider actually ran a node.
//!
//! The device-resident *activation* map is **not** here — it is
//! `super::gpu_activations`, which owns the name → buffer mapping, the last-use
//! schedule and the "may this value stay on the device" rule. This module keeps
//! only the placement arithmetic and the counters, which is the split that lets
//! the size gate be unit-tested without a device.
//!
//! The measurements that sized every constant below, on an M3 with
//! `examples/r3a_cost_breakdown.rs` and
//! `examples/r3a_inswapper_residency.rs`:
//!
//! * A full InSwapper forward through `run_gpu_async` spends ~75% of its GPU
//!   wall clock inside the `Conv` kernel itself, which C3 already established
//!   runs at 554–692 GFLOP/s — near this codebase's ceiling.
//! * The traffic residency would remove is ~553 MB of weight re-upload plus
//!   ~488 MiB of activation read-back per frame. At the measured ~5 GiB/s
//!   effective round-trip bandwidth that is roughly 95–200 ms of an ~880 ms
//!   frame: real, worth doing, and **not** the multiple the wave assumed.
//! * Meanwhile the same measurement found something with a much better
//!   payoff-to-risk ratio, which *is* implemented here: seven of the ten
//!   GPU-dispatched op types were running slower than their CPU kernels, some
//!   by 19–37x. Fixing that is a gate, not a rewrite.
//!
//! **The weight half of that traffic is now gone.** A graph's initializers are
//! uploaded once per session and bound from a device-side cache thereafter —
//! `oxionnx_gpu::context::resident`, owned by the `GpuContext` because that is
//! what makes the buffers die on the device's own thread (see
//! `super::gpu_owner`). This module contributes the *identity*, which is the
//! part `oxionnx-gpu` must not know: `initializer_key` in `super::gpu_dispatch`
//! (private, so named rather than linked) decides which of a node's inputs are
//! graph initializers,
//! and [`GpuRunStats::weight_cache_hits`] and friends report what the cache
//! did.
//!
//! **The activation half is now gone too.** A value produced by one GPU node and
//! consumed by the next stays in its device buffer for the whole run
//! (`super::gpu_activations`), so the read-back-and-re-upload between them
//! happens only where a CPU-placed consumer or a graph output actually needs
//! host bytes. That is what makes [`ResidencyTier::Resident`] reachable, and
//! with it the memory-bound gate that [`MEMORY_BOUND_TRANSFER_FLOOR`] holds
//! shut for every transferring node.
//!
//! The full reasoning, including why the elementwise ops lose at *every* size
//! while transferring, is on [`gpu_min_transfer_elements`].
//!
//! # The decline-to-CPU contract
//!
//! Unchanged in kind: a node this module declines is never an error. It returns
//! `Ok(None)` from `try_gpu_dispatch_async` and runs on the CPU operator from
//! ordinary host tensors, exactly as an unsupported node always has.
//!
//! What has changed is the *cost* of declining. A declined node whose operands
//! are on the device has to materialize them first — once per tensor per run,
//! memoized into the run state — so the decline side of the resident tier pays
//! a read-back the transferring tier never did. That asymmetry is the whole
//! reason [`RESIDENT_DISPATCH_FLOOR`] is a fill-one-workgroup floor rather than
//! a beat-the-CPU one; see it for the arithmetic.

///   every size. Hence `usize::MAX`, which is a claim ("never, while
///   transferring"), not a disabled feature.
/// * `Conv`/`Pad`/`Resize` win because their arithmetic per transferred byte
