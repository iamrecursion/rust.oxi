//! Asynchronous sequential execution path — the browser's run loop.
//!
//! # Why a second loop exists
//!
//! `run_sequential_inner` (see `super::sequential`) is synchronous top to
//! bottom, and it has to stay that way: it is the native engine's hot path, it
//! is shared with the rayon-parallel path, and none of the native execution
//! providers (CUDA, DirectML, CoreML) has an asynchronous interface to begin
//! with. WebGPU has *only* an asynchronous one — a browser thread may not block
//! on a GPU fence, so `Device::poll(Wait)` is a no-op there and every read-back
//! must be awaited.
//!
//! Rather than make the whole engine `async` to serve one backend on one
//! target, this module adds a second, deliberately smaller loop that runs the
//! same nodes in the same order and differs in exactly one place: it *awaits*
//! the wgpu dispatcher instead of blocking on it. Everything else — shape
//! resolution, reference counting, the in-place / slot-write fast paths, the
//! mixed-precision policy, the CPU operator dispatch — is the same code the
//! synchronous loop calls, reached through the same `pub(crate)` helpers.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! * **No parallel variant.** `wasm32-unknown-unknown` has no threads on any
//!   path this crate compiles, and the ordering contract below forbids
//!   overlapping GPU nodes anyway.
//! * **No CUDA / DirectML / CoreML arms.** None of them exists in a browser,
//!   and on native the synchronous loop already covers them.
//!
//! # Ordering contract
//!
//! Exactly one GPU node is in flight at a time. This is not a simplification:
//! wgpu error scopes are a per-thread LIFO stack whose native backend *panics*
//! if scopes are popped out of order, and `oxionnx-gpu` pushes one per dispatch.
//! A future "run two nodes concurrently" optimization has to give each
//! concurrent stream its own device, not just its own `await`.
