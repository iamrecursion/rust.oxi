//! ```text
//! 1. mixed precision   — `mixed_precision && should_use_f16(op)` claims the node
//!                        outright and no execution provider is offered it at all.
//!                        See `mixed_precision_claims_node`.
//! 2. provider list     — when `Session::providers` is non-empty, the user's
//!                        explicit ordered list decides, terminating at the CPU
//!                        sentinel.  `op_placement` is not consulted at all; the
//!                        one size rule that still binds is the hard
//!                        `MIN_GPU_DISPATCH_BYTES` floor.  See
//!                        `Session::try_provider_list_dispatch` and
//!                        `Session::provider_list_clears_dispatch_floor`.
//! 3. legacy heuristic  — otherwise `decide_placement` decides, and the
//!                        CUDA → DirectML → wgpu → CPU chain is walked from
//!                        whichever provider it names.  See `accelerator_gate`.
//! 4. CPU               — the terminal fallback, always.
//! ```
//!
//! The size every rule in (2) and (3) is stated in comes from the one canonical
//! `Session::estimate_output_bytes` in `run/dispatch.rs`.  This file used to carry
//! a private copy of it, because that function was `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]` and so
//! did not exist in the `cuda`-only build that needed it most; the `#[cfg]` has

// ── Mixed precision ⟂ execution providers ────────────────────────────────────

/// Does the mixed-precision path claim this node **to the exclusion of every
/// execution provider**?
///
/// # The collision
///
/// DirectML's kernel set is `MatMul | Add | Mul | Relu | Sigmoid`; CUDA's is far
/// larger but likewise covers `Add | Sub | Mul | Div | Relu | Sigmoid | Tanh |
/// Gelu | …`.  `should_use_f16` covers the f16-safe elementwise ops — `Add | Sub
/// | Mul | Div | Relu | Sigmoid | Tanh | …`.  The two sets very nearly coincide:
/// they collide on precisely the ops mixed precision exists to accelerate.
///
/// Because the accelerator gates are evaluated *before* the mixed-precision
/// block, `with_mixed_precision(true)` plus a live accelerator used to mean the
/// node ran on the GPU **in f32** and neither the native-f16 kernel nor the
/// f16 rounding of the outputs ever happened.  Mixed precision was silently a
/// no-op for exactly the ops it was configured for.
///
/// # The precedence, stated explicitly: **`mixed_precision` wins**
///
/// When this returns `true` the node is *never* offered to CUDA, DirectML, wgpu
/// or the explicit provider list — not even to the provider list, which is just
/// as explicit a user request as `with_mixed_precision(true)` is.  Reasons, in
/// order of weight:
///
/// 1. **There is no f16 GPU kernel anywhere in this workspace.**  Every backend
///    (`oxionnx-cuda`, `oxionnx-directml`, `oxionnx-gpu`) uploads, computes and
///    reads back `f32`.  So "accelerator wins" does not trade precision for
///    speed — it silently *discards the precision request altogether* and gives
///    back f32 results.  A flag that is silently ignored is worse than a flag
///    that is slow.
/// 2. **Numerics must not depend on which machine you run on.**  Under
///    "accelerator wins", the same model with the same flag produces f16-rounded
///    values on a CPU-only box and full-f32 values on a box with a GPU.  That is
///    a non-reproducibility bug, and it is invisible: nothing warns.
/// 3. **The cost is bounded and the win is not.**  These are elementwise ops:
///    memory-bound, arithmetic intensity ≈ 1.  They are the *least* profitable
///    ops to ship across PCIe, and giving them up to the CPU costs a
///    bandwidth-bound pass, not an algorithmic blow-up.  `MatMul`, `Gemm` and
///    `Conv` — the ops with the arithmetic intensity that actually justifies a
///    round trip — are **not** in `should_use_f16`, so they keep their
///    accelerator.  The precedence therefore only ever redirects the cheap ops.
///
/// This precedence is pinned by `mixed_precision_beats_every_accelerator_gate`
/// and `matmul_keeps_its_accelerator_under_mixed_precision` in this file's test
/// module.
///
/// # When to revisit
///
/// The moment any backend grows a genuine f16 kernel, this rule should be
/// narrowed to "mixed precision wins *unless* the chosen provider has an f16
/// kernel for this op" — i.e. the predicate gains a provider argument.  It is
/// deliberately a single function so that change has exactly one call site.

/// # What this fixes
///
/// The old gates were `self.cuda.is_some() && !matches!(op_placement, CpuOnly)`
/// and `self.dml.is_some() && !matches!(op_placement, CpuOnly)`.  They consulted
/// neither `decide_placement`, nor a size threshold, nor an op filter, with two
/// concrete consequences:
///
/// * `Auto { gpu_threshold_bytes: 1 << 30 }` — "only put enormous tensors on the
///   GPU" — still shipped a `[1, 4]` f32 bias-add (16 bytes) across PCIe:
///   upload → dispatch → fence-wait → readback, a ~20 µs fixed floor, to replace
///   ~4 ns of f32 addition.  On a bias-heavy graph that is a catastrophic
///   slowdown, and the user had explicitly asked for it not to happen.
/// * `Manual(map)` pinning only `{Conv: Gpu}` still rerouted `MatMul`, `Add`,
///   `Mul`, `Relu` and `Sigmoid` to DirectML, because the DirectML gate never
///   looked at the map at all.
///
/// Both are now impossible: an unpinned or below-threshold node makes
/// `decide_placement` return `ProviderKind::Cpu`, and every gate below is then
/// `false`.
///
/// # The fall-through chain
///
/// `decide_placement` names *one* provider.  But a provider that has a kernel for
/// an op *kind* may still decline an individual node whose configuration is out
/// of range (`Ok(None)`) — `provider_supports_op` is explicitly documented as
/// "necessary, not sufficient", and `select_accelerator` tells callers to "still
/// fall through the chain" in that case.  So a declined node must be able to
/// reach the next-best accelerator, which is what the legacy
/// CUDA → DirectML → wgpu → CPU cascade did.  That is preserved here:
///
/// * **`Auto`** — the session asked for "the best accelerator that can take this
///   op", so a decline falls through to every *lower-priority* accelerator that
///   also has a kernel for the op.  (`decide_placement` returned the
///   highest-priority supporter, so "lower priority" and "not the chosen one"
///   coincide.)  The size threshold has already been cleared by
///   `decide_placement`, so it binds the whole chain, not just its head.
/// * **`Manual`** — the user pinned *this* op to *that* provider.  Quietly
///   rerouting it to a different accelerator when the pinned one declines would
///   re-introduce exactly the `{Conv: Gpu}` bug above.  Only the pinned provider
///   is offered the node; the CPU is the sole fallback.
/// * **`CpuOnly`** — no accelerator, ever.
///
/// The chain itself is realised by the *ordering of the dispatch blocks* in
/// `run_sequential_inner`: they run CUDA, then DirectML, then wgpu, and a
/// provider that handles the node `continue`s the loop, so no lower-priority
/// gate is ever reached.  This function is a pure predicate over one candidate.

    // not keep: a run whose kernels the oracle had just caught disagreeing with
