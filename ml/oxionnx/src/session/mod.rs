/// # Why a session needs more than one plan

/// `Session` is `Send + Sync` and is routinely parked in an `Arc` behind a web
/// handler, so runs with different batch sizes interleave. The single-slot memo
/// in `resolved_shapes` holds exactly one plan, so two alternating batch sizes
/// miss it on *every* run and each pay a full `infer_shapes` pass over every
/// node — negligible for a toy graph, real for a 1000-node model on a request
/// path. Keeping the last few plans turns that back into a lookup.
///
/// # Correctness
///
/// A plan is a pure function of the input shapes: `infer_shapes` reads only
/// `sorted_nodes` and `weights`, both immutable for the life of the session.
/// The key is therefore the whole input-shape map compared for equality, which
/// is strictly stronger than the single-slot memo's per-input check and cannot
/// return another run's shapes.
///
/// # Contention
///
/// One `Mutex` held for the duration of a `Vec` scan of at most
/// [`MAX_CACHED_SHAPE_PLANS`] entries, each comparison being a map equality on
/// the (few) model inputs. A poisoned lock is not an error — it simply bypasses
/// the cache — so one panicking thread cannot break every later run.

// ── Auto-trait invariant ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Session: Send + Sync` is a HARD, load-bearing requirement, not a nicety:
//
//   * `run_parallel_inner` (src/session/run/parallel.rs) hands `&self` to
//     rayon's `par_iter()`.  Sharing `&Session` across worker threads requires
//     `Session: Sync`, and moving one into a rayon pool requires `Session: Send`.
//   * Callers routinely park a `Session` in an `Arc` behind a web handler or a
//     thread pool, which requires both.
//
// Today this holds *by accident* on some configurations.  `DirectMLContext` is
// currently a zero-sized struct, so `Session` stays `Send + Sync` for free.  The
// moment it holds a real `ID3D12Device` / `IDMLDevice`, it stops: Windows COM
// interface pointers are apartment-bound and are `!Send + !Sync`.  Without this
// assertion the failure would surface as a wall of inscrutable rayon trait-bound
// errors from *parallel.rs*, far away from the field that actually broke it.
//
// The assertion is enforced under every *native* feature combination — no
// features, `gpu`, `cuda`, `directml`, and all together.  Any provider context
// added to `Session` must be `Send + Sync` (wrap non-thread-safe device handles
// in a `Mutex`, or make the context own a thread-confined worker it talks to
// via channels).
//
// ── Why wasm32 is exempt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every reason above is a *threading* reason, and wasm32-unknown-unknown has no
// threads on any path this crate takes:
//
//   * `run_parallel_inner`'s rayon dependency is declared only for
//     `cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))` (see the root `Cargo.toml`), and
//     `run_internal` forces `use_parallel = false` there, so no `&Session` is
//     ever shared across workers.
//   * `session::async_run` — the only other cross-thread user — is compiled out
//     entirely on wasm32 (see its module gate above).
//   * A wasm session is single-owner by construction: the wasm-bindgen surface
//     that wraps it (`crate::wasm::WasmSession`) is itself `!Send`, because
//     every JS handle it can hold is, so a `Send` bound on `Session` could not
//     buy a caller anything even if it held.
//
// And it cannot hold: with `--features wasm,gpu` the session owns a
// `GpuContext`, whose `wgpu::Device`/`Queue`/`Buffer` are `Rc`-backed
// `WebDevice`/`WebBuffer` handles on the WebGPU backend — `!Send + !Sync` by
// construction, since a `GPUDevice` belongs to the JS agent that created it and
// cannot cross a worker boundary at all. Asserting `Send + Sync` there does not
// catch a bug; it forbids the only GPU backend the browser has.
//
// This is a compile-time check with zero runtime cost: it is evaluated during
// const-checking and produces no code.
