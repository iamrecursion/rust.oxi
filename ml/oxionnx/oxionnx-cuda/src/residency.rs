//! Session-lifetime reuse of device memory: a scratch-buffer pool and a
//! weight-residency cache, both owned by the [`CudaContext`](crate::CudaContext).
//!
//! # The cost this removes
//!
//! Every op in this crate used to build its device memory from scratch on
//! *every* dispatch: `DeviceBuffer::alloc` for each operand and the output, a
//! host upload for each operand, the kernel, a fence, a readback, and then
//! `cuMemFree` for all of them as the buffers dropped at the end of the
//! function. Nothing survived the call. For a train-once workload that is
//! invisible; for the workload this crate exists for — three ONNX graphs run
//! once per video frame, for hundreds of frames, with identical shapes and
//! identical weights every time — it is most of the cost:
//!
//! * **`cuMemAlloc`/`cuMemFree` are not cheap and are not asynchronous.** They
//!   serialise against the device and against each other. A graph with 150
//!   nodes pays several hundred of them per frame to hand back the same size
//!   classes it asked for on the previous frame.
//! * **Weight uploads are pure waste after the first frame.** A graph
//!   initializer holds the same bytes on frame 1 and frame 10 000. ArcFace's
//!   embedding head alone is a 49 MiB matrix; InSwapper's twelve AdaIN
//!   projections are 4 MiB each. Re-uploading them every frame is tens of
//!   milliseconds of bus time buying nothing.
//! * **`DeviceBuffer::copy_from_host` ends in a full `cuCtxSynchronize`** (see
//!   its own doc comment for why: it makes the "pageable upload has landed"
//!   postcondition hold against a non-blocking stream). Correct, but it is a
//!   *context*-wide fence paid per operand. Uploading onto the stream the
//!   kernel will run on gets the same ordering guarantee from stream order
//!   alone, with no fence at all.
//!
//! `DevicePool` closes the first, `ResidentWeights` the second, and
//! `PooledBuffer::upload` the third.
//!
//! # This is the CUDA analogue of what the wgpu backend already does
//!
//! `oxionnx`'s own wgpu path solved exactly this problem in
//! `oxionnx_gpu::context::resident` (weights uploaded once per session and
//! bound from a device-side cache) and `oxionnx::session::gpu_activations`
//! (a GPU-produced value staying on the device for its next GPU consumer).
//! This module is the first of those two, for CUDA, and deliberately mirrors
//! its shape — including the part that matters most: a cached identity is
//! **checked, not trusted** (see `ResidentWeights::acquire`).
//!
//! The activation half is *not* here, and that is a scope statement rather
//! than an omission: `try_cuda_dispatch` returns a host [`Tensor`](oxionnx_core::Tensor)
//! per node because its caller (`oxionnx`'s sequential/parallel runners) hands
//! it host tensors and expects host tensors back. Keeping an activation on the
//! device across a node boundary requires the *session* to own the
//! name→buffer map and the last-use schedule, exactly as `gpu_activations`
//! does for wgpu; there is nothing this crate can do about it from inside a
//! single dispatch. What this module does buy on the activation side is that
//! the buffers those round trips land in are recycled rather than
//! reallocated.
//!
//! # Why the caches live on the context
//!
//! One [`CudaContext`](crate::CudaContext) is built per `oxionnx::Session`, so
//! context-scoped is session-scoped — which is the exact lifetime over which a
//! graph initializer's bytes are invariant. It also puts every buffer's `Drop`
//! (a `cuMemFree` against this context) inside the lifetime of the
//! `Arc<Context>` the same struct holds, so the frees cannot outlive the
//! context they belong to.
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! `oxionnx::Session` is `Send + Sync` (a hard, asserted requirement — see its
//! auto-trait invariant), and `oxionnx`'s parallel runner hands `&Session`,
//! and therefore `&CudaContext`, to rayon workers. Both caches are therefore
//! `Mutex`-guarded, and every lock is released before any driver call that
//! could block. A poisoned lock is never fatal here: it degrades to the
//! pre-cache behaviour (allocate fresh, upload every time), because nothing
//! about *correctness* depends on a cache hit.

// ─── pinned staging ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `oxicuda_dnn::DnnHandle` already owns a `StagingBuffer` (`handle.rs:358-531`
// at the time this was written), but every entry point that reaches it takes
// `&mut self` — unusable from here, since every dispatch in this crate holds
// only `&CudaContext`. `DeviceCaches` gets its own, guarded by a `Mutex` so it
// is reachable through the same `&self` every other cache method already
// uses (see the module docs' "Thread safety" section: a lock here is
// released before any driver call that could block *except* the staged
// transfer itself, which cannot be split that way — see the note on
// contention in [`stage_or_async_upload`]).
//
// # Why `upload_with`/`download_into`, never `upload`/`download`
//
// `oxicuda_memory::StagingBuffer` offers two shapes of staged transfer (see
// its own module docs for the measured table): the convenience wrappers
// `upload`/`download`, which `memcpy` between the caller's ordinary slice and
// the pinned buffer and therefore *auto-select* — silently falling back to
// the driver's plain pageable path above
// [`DEFAULT_AUTO_STAGE_MAX_BYTES`](oxicuda_memory::DEFAULT_AUTO_STAGE_MAX_BYTES)
// (512 KiB), because that extra host copy loses to the driver's own pipelined
// staging past roughly that size — and `upload_with`/`download_into`, which
// write into (or read out of) the pinned buffer directly with **no**
// intermediate copy and are measured to win at every size the crate's own
// table covers (150 KiB-4.7 MiB, 1.55x-2.67x). This module always uses the
// latter pair and enforces its own floor below, which runs in the *opposite*
// sense from that 512 KiB auto-select: the direct pair has no upper bound
// where it stops paying off, so [`STAGING_MIN_BYTES`] exists only to skip the
// `Mutex` lock and the reused-allocation bookkeeping for a transfer too small
// for either to matter (a handful of floats — a bias vector, a scalar) has no
// business contending for the one pinned allocation this context holds.
//
// # Where this is (and is not) wired in
//
// Two call sites, both already-blocking boundaries where staging is a pure
// win with no new fence introduced:
//
// * [`ResidentWeights::acquire`]'s "first sighting" branch (see its own
//   comment) — a weight uploads *once* per session, so paying
//   `StagingBuffer`'s internal `stream.synchronize()` there costs nothing in
//   steady state.
// * [`DeviceCaches::staged_download`], used by [`crate::activation::finish_output`]'s
//   `Host`-placement branch and by [`crate::activation::CudaDeviceTensor::read_back`]
//   — the two places a device-resident value crosses back to the host, both
//   of which already ended in a blocking `stream.synchronize()` before this
//   existed.
//
// Deliberately **not** wired into [`PooledBuffer::upload`] (there is no
// `PooledBuffer::download` any more: [`DeviceCaches::staged_download`]
// replaced its one call site in [`crate::activation::finish_output`]
// outright rather than sitting beside it) or [`ResidentWeights::transient`]:
// those are the steady-state, per-frame,
// *asynchronous* path residency exists to keep fence-free (see
// `PooledBuffer::upload`'s own "Stream ordering is the whole point"). Every
// call to `StagingBuffer::upload_with`/`download_into` is synchronous by
// construction — inserting one into that path would trade a bandwidth win for
// a fence that was not there before, undoing exactly the property residency
// was built to get.
