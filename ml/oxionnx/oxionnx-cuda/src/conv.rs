//! CUDA 2-D convolution dispatch.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! [`cuda_conv`] dispatches ONNX `Conv` nodes directly to three of
//! `oxicuda-dnn`'s forward-convolution engines —
//! [`Conv1x1`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::Conv1x1),
//! [`DepthwiseConv`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::DepthwiseConv), and
//! [`ImplicitGemmConv`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::implicit_gemm::ImplicitGemmConv)
//! — each independently validated on real hardware (`cargo test -p
//! oxicuda-dnn --features gpu-tests conv`: 396 passed / 0 failed on this
//! machine's RTX A4000, sm_86, including the numeric-CPU-oracle tests for
//! all three engines: `conv1x1_f32_nchw_matches_cpu`, the depthwise
//! strided/dilated f32/f64 cases, and the implicit-GEMM 3x3
//! general/strided/dilated/grouped/bias NCHW+NHWC f32/f64 cases). For a
//! shape it recognises (see "Dispatch rule" below) it uploads, launches,
//! downloads, and returns a real answer; for everything else it returns
//! `Ok(None)` so the caller falls back to the CPU (or wgpu).
//!
//! ## Why not `oxicuda_dnn::conv::api::conv_forward`
//!
//! The natural-looking implementation would hand a
//! [`ConvProblem`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::descriptor::ConvProblem) to
//! `conv_forward` and let its `algo_select::select_algorithm` auto-selector
//! pick an engine. That must not be used here: for some shapes the
//! auto-selector routes into the Winograd fprop path, whose safety for
//! every eligible shape is tracked and gated by a separate, sibling fix in
//! this same investigation. Rather than make this dispatch's correctness
//! depend on whether that gate has landed, [`cuda_conv`] bypasses
//! `conv_forward`/`select_algorithm` entirely and calls the three engines
//! above directly, by hand, from its own small dispatch rule — see
//! [`pick_engine`]. None of the three engines this function calls ever
//! touch the Winograd path, so this dispatch is correct regardless of the
//! sibling fix's state.
//!
//! ## Dispatch rule
//!
//! Given the [`ConvProblem`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::descriptor::ConvProblem)
//! built from [`ConvParams`] and the ONNX input/filter shapes:
//!
//! 0. The shape is claimed by `oxicuda-dnn`'s CTA-tiled implicit-GEMM kernel
//!    (`TiledConvPlan::for_problem`) →
//!    [`ImplicitGemmConv`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::implicit_gemm::ImplicitGemmConv),
//!    which dispatches to that kernel internally. This rule runs *first*,
//!    ahead of the 1x1 rule, because the tiling wins by a wide margin
//!    wherever it applies — measured on an RTX A4000
//!    (`oxicuda-dnn/benches/conv_engine_gflops_regression`): a 256->512
//!    pointwise convolution over 64x64 runs at **480 GFLOPS on `Conv1x1`
//!    and 7345 GFLOPS tiled (15.3x)**, and the 3x3 layers of all three
//!    face-pipeline models go from 875-1006 GFLOPS to 6.1-8.3 TFLOPS.
//!    Routing through `ImplicitGemmConv` also moves the bias and the fused
//!    activation onto the device (see below), where `Conv1x1` forces both
//!    onto the host.
//!    The tiling declines every grouped convolution, so rule 2 is unaffected.
//! 1. `filter == 1x1 && stride == [1,1] && dilation == [1,1] && padding ==
//!    [0,0]` → [`Conv1x1`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::Conv1x1).
//! 2. `groups == in_channels && groups == out_channels` (true depthwise,
//!    checked *after* rule 1 — a filter that is simultaneously 1x1 *and*
//!    depthwise-shaped still takes the
//!    [`Conv1x1`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::Conv1x1) path) →
//!    [`DepthwiseConv`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::DepthwiseConv).
//! 3. Everything else →
//!    [`ImplicitGemmConv`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::implicit_gemm::ImplicitGemmConv),
//!    the general-purpose engine (arbitrary padding, stride, dilation and
//!    grouping).
//!
//! See [`pick_engine`] for the exact, unit-tested-without-a-GPU
//! implementation.
//!
//! ## The fused-activation epilogue
//!
//! ONNX `Conv` nodes reaching this module may carry an optimizer-fused
//! activation ([`ConvActivation`]), which is part of what the node computes.
//! `cuda_conv_cached` applies it after the bias, either on the device
//! (`Relu`, via `launch_activation_epilogue` — one extra memory-bound
//! kernel on the same stream, before the readback) or on the host
//! (`apply_conv_activation_host` — used for `Clip`, which has no
//! scalar-bounded kernel, and for any activation on an engine that still owes
//! a host-side bias add, since the activation must follow the bias).
//!
//! Neither [`Conv1x1::execute`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::Conv1x1)
//! nor [`DepthwiseConv::execute`](oxicuda_dnn::conv::fprop::direct::DepthwiseConv)
//! accepts a bias argument at all — their `execute` methods hard-code a
//! null bias pointer internally, with no parameter to override it. When the
//! ONNX node supplies a bias and dispatch takes either of those two paths,
//! [`cuda_conv`] adds it on the host after the download instead (see
//! [`add_bias_nchw`]). `ImplicitGemmConv` does support a native bias
//! epilogue in its kernel and is given the bias descriptor directly.
//!
//! ## What still declines
//!
//! [`ConvProblem`]'s padding is symmetric-only (one value per spatial
//! dimension); ONNX's `pads` attribute is `[pad_top, pad_left, pad_bottom,
//! pad_right]` and can be asymmetric. Rather than silently use only one
//! side's padding value, [`cuda_conv`] declines (`Ok(None)`) whenever
//! `pads[0] != pads[2] || pads[1] != pads[3]`. It also declines: a non-4-D
//! input/filter shape; a `group` that does not divide `in_channels` or
//! `out_channels` evenly; a filter whose declared per-group input-channel
//! count disagrees with the input tensor; a zero-sized dimension; a filter
//! that does not fit the (padded) input; and a `Tensor` whose `data` is
//! shorter than its declared `shape` promises (release builds do not
//! validate that invariant at construction — see
//! [`oxionnx_core::Tensor::new`]'s own doc comment). Every one of these
//! means "this configuration is not accelerated", not "the model is
//! broken" — the CPU operator one frame up computes it correctly (or
//! raises the right diagnostic) either way. See [`problem_from_params`].
//!
//! [`conv_params_from_attrs`] declines a second, separate class: a node
//! whose *attributes* say something this backend does not model. An
//! `activation` string other than `"relu"`/`"clip"`, an `auto_pad` value
//! outside `NOTSET`/`VALID`/`SAME_UPPER`/`SAME_LOWER`, a `kernel_shape`
//! contradicting the filter, a negative stride/dilation/pad, a `group` below
//! 1, or a spatial attribute that is not 2-D. That whitelist is the fix for
//! the failure this module actually shipped: it read `strides`/`pads`/
//! `dilations`/`group` and *ignored everything else*, so the optimizer's
//! fused activation (`Conv_*_fused_activation`, see [`ConvActivation`]) was
//! silently dropped from 24 of SCRFD det_10g's convolutions and every
//! detection collapsed to a degenerate corner box. Ignoring an attribute is
//! never a safe default; declining is.
//!
//! ## Advertised as CUDA-supported
//!
//! [`crate::is_supported_op`] reports `true` for `OpKind::Conv`, so
//! `oxionnx::execution_providers::decide_placement` routes convolutions here
//! and `oxionnx`'s session runners reach this function on the hot path. It is
//! production dispatch, not a direct-call-only escape hatch.
//!
//! Being advertised is a claim about the op *kind*, not a promise about every
//! node: the configurations listed under "What still declines" above still
//! come back `Ok(None)` and are computed by the CPU operator one frame up —
//! exactly as an over-wide `Softmax` row or a broadcasting `Add` already do.
//! Callers must handle `Ok(None)` from a `Conv` node the same way they
//! already handle it from every other advertised op (see
//! [`crate::is_supported_op`]'s "Necessary, not sufficient").
//!
//! The advertisement rests on the same footing as every other claimable op in
//! this crate, not a weaker one: this arm's output is shadow-verifiable
//! against a [`crate::reference`] CPU oracle.
//! [`crate::reference::ref_conv`] is that oracle, and
//! [`crate::try_cuda_dispatch`]'s `Conv` arm hands it to the same
//! `verify_or_fallback` gate every other arm uses — so `OXIONNX_CUDA_VERIFY=1`
//! shadow-verifies a `Conv` dispatch element by element, discarding a
//! mismatching GPU result in favour of the CPU under the default
//! [`FailurePolicy::Fallback`](crate::context::FailurePolicy) and raising a
//! hard error under `OXIONNX_CUDA_STRICT=1`.
//!
//! ## Validation
//!
//! Numerically checked on this machine's RTX A4000 three different ways.
//! First, directly against each of the three dispatched engines
//! (`Conv1x1`/`DepthwiseConv`/`ImplicitGemmConv`) via an independent,
//! `f64`-accumulated, from-scratch NCHW cross-correlation reference written
//! in this module's own `tests` submodule (deliberately *not*
//! `crate::reference::ref_conv` — two independently-written oracles that
//! agree are stronger evidence than one oracle checked against itself): a
//! 1x1 conv with and without bias (exercising both `Conv1x1` and the
//! host-side bias add), a dilated depthwise conv with bias (exercising
//! `DepthwiseConv` and the same host-side bias add), and 3x3 stride-1 and
//! stride-2 convolutions with bias (exercising `ImplicitGemmConv`'s native
//! bias epilogue). Run with `cargo test -p oxionnx-cuda --features
//! gpu-tests conv` on a CUDA-capable host. Second, end-to-end through
//! [`crate::try_cuda_dispatch`] itself with `OXIONNX_CUDA_VERIFY=1` live in
//! the process environment, against [`crate::reference::ref_conv`] — see
//! `conv_verify_path_agrees_live_on_real_hardware` in
//! `oxionnx-cuda/tests/verify_path_gpu.rs`. Third, along the full production
//! sequence this advertisement switches on — [`crate::is_supported_op`]
//! pre-filter, then [`crate::try_cuda_dispatch`], then an
//! [`crate::reference::ref_conv`] comparison — plus the complementary case
//! that an advertised-but-undispatchable configuration (asymmetric `pads`)
//! is still declined rather than silently computed with the wrong padding:
//! `conv_claimed_by_the_pre_filter_is_actually_dispatched` and
//! `advertised_conv_still_declines_the_configurations_it_cannot_compute` in
//! `lib.rs`'s `gpu-tests` module.
