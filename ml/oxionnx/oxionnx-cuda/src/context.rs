//! CUDA context wrapper for oxionnx-cuda.
//!
//! [`CudaContext`] holds a CUDA device context together with a [`DnnHandle`]
//! (which itself contains a `BlasHandle`, PTX cache, and stream).  A single
//! `CudaContext` is created once at `Session` build time and shared across all
//! op dispatches within a session run.
//!
//! ## Activation is OPT-IN, and that is a decision, not an oversight
//!
//! This crate's own CI has no CUDA-capable host: every line under this crate
//! is type-checked and unit-tested there (the pure, allocation-light logic —
//! shape decomposition, broadcast rules, attribute decoding, the
//! [`crate::reference`] oracle) on a machine with no GPU. A `gpu-tests`
//! Cargo feature — off by default, run manually with `cargo test -p
//! oxionnx-cuda --features gpu-tests` on a CUDA-capable machine — covers the
//! rest: real dispatches against a real device, including the cross-thread
//! `CudaContext` regression tests in this crate's own `tests` module.
//! Enabling that feature on a host with no device is harmless: every
//! on-device fixture returns `Option<CudaContext>` and its tests skip, so
//! `--all-features` stays green on a CPU-only machine (see the feature's
//! own comment in `Cargo.toml`). What
//! stays true regardless is the point this section is making: *default*
//! `cargo test`/CI never touches a GPU, so the table below is what actually
//! gates whether a user's inference run does.
//!
//! A GPU kernel bug does not crash.  A transposed index, a truncated
//! reduction, an axis the kernel silently assumes is the last one — each of
//! these returns a buffer of exactly the right *length* and *shape*, full of
//! plausible-looking wrong numbers, which then propagate silently through the
//! rest of the inference graph.  Shipping that **on by default** would mean
//! quietly corrupting the output of every user who happened to build with
//! `--features cuda` on a CUDA-capable machine.  (This is not hypothetical:
//! findings a8-0 through a8-4 fixed in this same wave were exactly that kind
//! of bug, and `try_cuda_dispatch` returned `Ok(Some(wrong_data))` — a
//! successful answer — for every one of them.)
//!
//! So, mirroring `oxionnx-directml`'s identical rationale for the identical
//! reason:
//!
//! | Environment variable | Default | Effect |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ACTIVATION_ENV_VAR`] (`OXIONNX_CUDA`) | **off** | [`CudaContext::try_new`] returns `None` until this is set (or the embedder passes [`Activation::Enabled`]).  `Session` holds `cuda: None`, and every node runs on the CPU. |
//! | [`crate::reference::VERIFY_ENV_VAR`] (`OXIONNX_CUDA_VERIFY`) | off | Shadow-compare every dispatched op against the CPU oracle in [`crate::reference`].  A mismatch is a kernel *failure*: the wrong numbers are thrown away, not returned. |
//! | [`STRICT_ENV_VAR`] (`OXIONNX_CUDA_STRICT`) | off | A shadow-verification *failure* becomes a hard `Err` instead of a silent CPU fallback. |
//! | [`crate::graph_cache::GRAPH_ENV_VAR`] (`OXIONNX_CUDA_GRAPH`) | off | Record each repeated fixed-shape `MatMul`/`Gemm` dispatch into a CUDA graph once and replay it with `cuGraphLaunch` thereafter.  Measured between -10% and +11% per call **depending on the shape** — see [`mod@crate::graph_cache`] for the table and for why the ceiling is that low. |
//!
//! ## `OXIONNX_CUDA_GRAPH` and `OXIONNX_CUDA_VERIFY` do not compose, deliberately
//!
//! Setting both leaves graphs **off** (with a `warn!`), because verification's
//! whole value is that it grades the code path production runs. Grading a
//! replayed graph instead would quietly change what a `VERIFY=1` run is
//! evidence for — it would stop being evidence that the *kernels* are right.
//! `OXIONNX_CUDA_STRICT` is orthogonal to both: it only decides whether a
//! verification mismatch is fatal.
//!
//! The bar for flipping [`ACTIVATION_ENV_VAR`]'s default to on is the same as
//! `oxionnx-directml`'s: run with `OXIONNX_CUDA_VERIFY=1` on real hardware,
//! across more than one input shape per op, and confirm zero mismatches.

// holds one in a field and asserts `Session: Send + Sync` itself (see its
// "Auto-trait invariant" block) because its parallel runner hands `&Session` to
// rayon workers and callers park sessions in an `Arc`. A field that stopped
// being `Sync` would surface there as a wall of rayon trait-bound errors in
// `session/run/parallel.rs`, far from the field that broke it.
//
// This became worth asserting *here* the moment this struct grew interior
// mutability: the caches below are the exact kind of field that silently drops
// `Sync` if someone reaches for a `RefCell` or an `Rc` for convenience.
// Compile-time only; it produces no code.
