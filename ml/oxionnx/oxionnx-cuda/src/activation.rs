//! Device-resident **activations**: the half of residency
//! [`mod@crate::residency`] deliberately left out.
//!
//! `residency` caches *initializers* — bytes that are invariant for the
//! session — and its module docs state the reason the activation half could
//! not live there: `try_cuda_dispatch` was handed host tensors per node and
//! returned host tensors per node, so two consecutive CUDA-claimed ops A → B
//! made B re-upload A's output from host memory, unconditionally. Measured
//! across the three face-pipeline models that was **1327 MB/frame** of PCIe
//! traffic and **237 blocking `stream.synchronize()` calls**, one per claimed
//! node.
//!
//! This module supplies the pieces that let a node's output stay where the
//! kernel wrote it:
//!
//! * [`CudaDeviceTensor`] — an *owned* device buffer plus the shape it holds.
//!   Owned rather than [`PooledBuffer`](crate::residency::PooledBuffer),
//!   because a pooled borrow dies at the end of the dispatch that took it and
//!   an activation has to outlive its producing node.
//! * [`InputBinding`] — one operand as the dispatcher sees it: host bytes to
//!   upload, or a buffer the run already left on the device.
//! * [`CudaDispatchOutcome`] / [`CudaOutputPlacement`] — what a dispatch
//!   produced, and what the session asked it to produce.
//! * [`ResidentActivations`] — the name → buffer lookup, implemented by the
//!   *session* (which is the only layer that knows node order, last use and
//!   graph outputs) and consumed here.
//!
//! # Why recycling a buffer with work still queued is safe here
//!
//! [`crate::residency::PooledBuffer`] refuses to recycle a borrow whose stream
//! work has not been confirmed finished, and its docs name the reason: this
//! crate used **two** streams (`DnnHandle`'s own and its `BlasHandle`'s), so a
//! buffer released by a convolution and picked up by a GEMM changed stream and
//! stream order stopped protecting it.
//!
//! That is no longer true. `oxicuda-dnn`'s `DnnHandle` now builds its BLAS
//! sub-handle on its *own* stream (`DnnHandle::build`), so every launch and
//! every copy this crate issues rides one queue, and
//! [`DnnHandle::streams_unified`](oxicuda_dnn::DnnHandle::streams_unified)
//! reports it. On one queue, a buffer handed back to the pool while a kernel
//! is still reading it is still safe: the next borrower's kernel is enqueued
//! *behind* that read, and the device executes the queue in order.
//!
//! Every recycle-without-a-fence in this module is therefore gated on
//! [`CudaContext::streams_unified`](crate::CudaContext::streams_unified)
//! rather than assumed — a handle built with `with_split_blas_stream` keeps
//! the old, conservative behaviour and loses reuse, not correctness.
