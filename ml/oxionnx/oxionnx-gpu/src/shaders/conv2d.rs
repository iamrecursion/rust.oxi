//! Direct NCHW Conv2D — implicit GEMM in WGSL, with fused bias and activation.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! [c3] `compute.rs`'s [`gpu_conv2d_async`](crate::compute::gpu_conv2d_async)
//! was a *hybrid*: im2col on the CPU, GEMM on the GPU, bias and activation
//! back on the CPU. That shape is wrong for a convolution network in three
//! separate ways, all of them measured:
//!
//! * **The column matrix is `kH*kW` times the input.** InSwapper's twelve
//!   `Conv[1024, 1024, 3, 3]` layers at `34x34` see a `[1024, 32, 32]` input
//!   (4 MB) but a `[9216, 1024]` column matrix (37.7 MB) — and the hybrid
//!   uploaded that column matrix *per call*, so one frame pushed ~595 MB of
//!   im2col across the bus that the input alone would have covered in ~50 MB.
//! * **The im2col itself is CPU work** on the critical path, serialized ahead
//!   of every dispatch.
//! * **Bias and activation were separate CPU passes** over the whole output.
//!
//! The end-to-end result was a GPU conv measurably *slower* than the rayon CPU
//! operator it was meant to accelerate (0.33-0.58x on Metal).
//!
//! This kernel uploads the input and the weights **as they are**, and never
//! materialises a column matrix anywhere — the im2col index arithmetic happens
//! inside the shader, in registers, as the input tile is staged into workgroup
//! memory. Bias and activation are folded into the epilogue, so the output is
//! read back already finished.
//!
//! # The implicit-GEMM mapping
//!
//! For one batch element, a `group = 1` convolution is exactly the GEMM
//!
//! ```text
//!   C[M, N] = A[M, K] * B[K, N]
//!   M = C_out                       (output channels)
//!   N = OH * OW                     (output pixels, row-major)
//!   K = C_in * kH * kW              (the "reduction" axis)
//!   A = the weight tensor, verbatim: A[oc, (ic*kH + ky)*kW + kx] = w[oc][ic][ky][kx]
//!   B = the column matrix, never materialised:
//!       B[(ic*kH + ky)*kW + kx, oy*OW + ox] = in[n][ic][oy*sh + ky*dh - pt][ox*sw + kx*dw - pl]
//!   C = the output, verbatim: C[oc, oy*OW + ox] = out[n][oc][oy][ox]
//! ```
//!
//! So `A` and `C` need no index translation at all — only `B`'s gather does,
//! and that is what makes the kernel "implicit".
//!
//! # Why the K loop is a `(ky, kx, ic)` nest rather than a flat `k` loop
//!
//! The obvious implicit-GEMM writes one loop over `k` and recovers
//! `(ic, ky, kx)` by dividing. That costs **four integer divisions per staged
//! element**, and this kernel stages 8 elements per thread per K-tile against
//! 256 FMAs — divisions at that density are comparable in cost to the
//! arithmetic they feed, i.e. a tax on the whole kernel rather than a detail.
//!
//! Instead the K axis is walked as an explicit `ky -> kx -> ic-tile` nest.
//! `ky` and `kx` are then *loop variables*, uniform across the workgroup, so
//! the decomposition never happens: the weight column is `ic*kH*kW + ky*kW +
//! kx` (one multiply-add) and the input row/column offsets are `base + ky*dh`
//! / `base + kx*dw` (one multiply-add each, hoisted to the `ky` and `kx` loop
//! headers respectively). Only `ic` is tiled into shared memory, and only the
//! *output-pixel* decomposition `j -> (oy, ox)` still needs a division — which
//! is loop-invariant, so it is computed **once per thread** in the prologue
//! (8 divisions for the whole kernel) rather than once per staged element.
//!
//! # Tile shape
//!
//! The macro-tile geometry is the register-tiled GEMM's in
//! `context/functions.rs` (`TILED_MATMUL_SHADER`, 242-434 GFLOP/s natively on
//! M3): a `64x64` macro-tile per workgroup, `16x16` threads, a `4x4` register
//! tile per thread, and a 16-deep shared tile of each operand. That shape is
//! right for this workload for the same reason it is right there —
//! InSwapper's dominant layer is `M = 1024, N = 1024, K = 9216` and the
//! decoder's is `M = 256, N = 16384, K = 4608`, both large in every dimension,
//! so the 16x arithmetic intensity of a `4x4` register tile is what keeps the
//! kernel off the shared-memory bandwidth wall.
//!
//! The one deliberate departure is that both shared tiles are **`vec4`
//! blocked** — `array<array<vec4<f32>, 16>, 16>`, block `b` holding elements
//! `b*4 .. b*4+3`. A thread's `4x4` register tile spans exactly rows
//! `ty*4..ty*4+3` and columns `tx*4..tx*4+3`, so one block *is* one thread's
//! operand set: the innermost loop reads two `vec4`s per 16 FMAs where the
//! scalar-tiled form read eight `f32`s, and the cooperative load writes one
//! whole block per thread instead of four scattered scalars. Measured against
//! the scalar-tiled version of this same kernel on M3
//! (`examples/c3_conv2d_gflops.rs`): the `128x128` decoder layer went 69-76 ms
//! to 55-56 ms (~507 -> ~692 GFLOP/s). The `32x32` bottleneck layer, which is
//! bound elsewhere, moved 40.0 -> ~35 ms.
//!
//! The 16 accumulators are individually-named scalars, not `array<f32, 16>` —
//! see `TILED_MATMUL_SHADER`'s doc comment for the measurement behind that
//! (naga's WGSL->MSL lowering did not promote the small loop-indexed arrays to
//! registers, making an array version *slower* than a naive kernel). The
//! `vec4` tiles above are the sanctioned exception: they are fixed-width
//! vectors with static component access, not dynamically-indexed arrays.
//!
//! # What declines
//!
//! `group > 1` and any shape the device cannot bind or dispatch return `None`,
//! which sends the caller to the hybrid path that is still in `compute.rs`.
//! Grouped convolution is not a gap in the mapping — it is a deliberate
//! omission: none of the three models this kernel exists for uses it, and a
//! depthwise conv (`C_out/group = 1`) against a `64`-row macro-tile would
//! waste 63/64 of the M tile, so it belongs on a differently-shaped kernel,
//! not this one. Dilation *is* supported (it is one multiply in the `ky`/`kx`
//! loop headers).
//!
//! Unlike the element-wise kernels, this file applies **no minimum-size
//! threshold** — see [`kernel_support`](super::kernel_support)'s module docs
//! for why a CPU/GPU placement heuristic belongs at the call site. The
//! threshold that used to gate the hybrid conv still gates both paths, in
//! `compute.rs`.
