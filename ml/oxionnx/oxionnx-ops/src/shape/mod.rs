//! Shape manipulation operations for tensors.
//!
//! This module provides ONNX-compatible shape operations including:
//! - Basic shape transforms: reshape, flatten, transpose, squeeze, unsqueeze
//! - Sequence operations: concat, slice, pad, split, tile
//! - Spatial rearrangements: depth_to_space, space_to_depth, reverse_sequence
