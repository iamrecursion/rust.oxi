# oxillama-gpu — TODO

## 1. Overview

`oxillama-gpu` is the wgpu-based GPU compute backend for OxiLLaMa. It is
cross-platform — Metal on macOS and iOS, Vulkan on Linux and Android, DX12 on
Windows, WebGPU in browsers — and Pure Rust end-to-end. wgpu is itself a
Rust-native implementation of the WebGPU standard, so no C, C++, or Fortran
code touches this path. That matters because it means the GPU backend
inherits the same COOLJAPAN Pure-Rust guarantees as the rest of the
workspace: no system BLAS, no proprietary drivers pulled in at link time, no
C build-time dependencies.

The crate is feature-gated behind the `gpu` cargo feature and is **off by
default**. Runtime behaviour is graceful: when no compatible adapter is
found, or when the `gpu` feature is disabled at compile time, the public API
still exists — `GpuDispatcher::new()` silently falls back to CPU and
`has_gpu()` returns `false`. Callers in `oxillama-runtime` can route matmul
through the dispatcher without branching on `cfg` of their own, and their
tests keep working on CI runners that have no GPU.

The v0.1.0 release ships a minimal but correct GPU path: f32-accumulator
GEMV shaders for Q4_0 and Q8_0, a `context` / `dispatcher` / `kernel`
abstraction, and 22 tests covering init, error `Display` output, and
gated end-to-end correctness against CPU reference values. The 72 %
completion figure reflects a working path for two quant types out of the
twenty-five the ecosystem eventually needs — the remaining work is mostly
shader coverage, batching, and attention fusion.

## 3. Module Map

- `src/lib.rs` — public API surface. Exposes `GpuDispatcher`, re-exports
  `GpuContext`, `GpuError`, `GpuResult`, and the kernel trait and impls.
- `src/context.rs` — `GpuContext` and `GpuContext::try_init()`. Owns the
  `wgpu::Device` and `Queue` and is the single point of adapter selection.
  Returns `None` cleanly when no adapter is available; never panics.
- `src/buffer.rs` — GPU buffer management helpers (staging, storage,
  readback). Centralises alignment rules and usage-flag combinations so
  kernels do not re-invent them.
- `src/kernels/mod.rs` — `GpuKernel` trait definition plus kernel registry
  wiring. The dispatcher's `match` on tensor type lives in `lib.rs`, but
  each kernel is registered through this module.
- `src/kernels/q4_0.rs` — `Q4_0GpuKernel` with the `gemv()` entry point.
  Handles bind-group setup, shader invocation, and readback.
- `src/kernels/q8_0.rs` — `Q8_0GpuKernel`, analogous layout for Q8_0.
- `src/error.rs` — `GpuError` defined with `thiserror`. Variants:
  `NoAdapter`, `DeviceRequest(String)`, `BufferSize { expected, got }`,
  `BufferMap { detail }`, `ShaderCompilation { detail }`,
  `UnsupportedType { name }`.
- `src/shaders/gemv_f32.wgsl` — WGSL compute shaders for Q4_0 and Q8_0
  f32-accumulator GEMV. Single shader file with multiple entry points to
  keep module compilation overhead low.

### Typical dispatch pattern (caller side)

The dispatcher is designed to be called without `unwrap()` on the hot path —
the early-return on `None` is enough to preserve CPU fallback without
branching on `cfg` or feature flags upstream.

```rust
use oxillama_gpu::GpuDispatcher;
use oxillama_gguf::GgufTensorType;

let dispatcher = GpuDispatcher::new();
let kernel = match dispatcher.get_kernel(GgufTensorType::Q4_0) {
    Some(k) => k,
    None => return cpu_gemv_q4_0(weights, input, output),
};
let ctx = match dispatcher.context() {
    Some(c) => c,
    None => return cpu_gemv_q4_0(weights, input, output),
};
kernel.gemv(ctx, weights, input, output, rows, cols)?;
```

## 4. Shipped in v0.1.0

- wgpu (workspace-pinned; 29.0.4 as of 2026-08-05) compute backend, with `pollster` 0.4 for blocking on async
  futures from sync contexts and `bytemuck` 1 for safe `#[repr(C)]` →
  byte-slice casts on host/device interchange structs.
- Cross-platform adapter selection: Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux and
  Android, DX12 on Windows, WebGPU in the browser. Driven entirely by the
  wgpu `Backends::PRIMARY` mask; no platform-specific code in this crate.
- Q4_0 WGSL f32 GEMV shader. Reads packed 4-bit blocks (32 weights per
  block, fp16 scale per block) and dot-products them against an f32 input
  vector, accumulating in f32 to match the CPU reference's numerics.
- Q8_0 WGSL f32 GEMV shader. Reads signed 8-bit blocks (32 weights per
  block, fp16 scale per block) and dot-products them against an f32 input
  vector. Same f32-accumulator contract as Q4_0.
- `GpuDispatcher::new()` and `GpuDispatcher::try_init()` — construct-and-
  detect pattern. `has_gpu()` reports availability without locking;
  `get_kernel(tensor_type)` returns `Some(Box<dyn GpuKernel>)` only when
  both a context and a matching kernel exist, `None` otherwise.
- `gpu` cargo feature flag. When disabled the crate still compiles and all
  public types are available as stubs — a required property so downstream
  crates (runtime, server) do not need their own `cfg` gating.
- 77 unit tests covering: dispatcher init without panic, `Default` impl,
  `F32` and `Q4K` returning `None` for `get_kernel`, every `GpuError`
  variant's `Display` output, and — gated on `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]` —
  end-to-end Q4_0 and Q8_0 GEMV correctness against a CPU dequant + dot
  reference (tolerance 1e-3). GPU tests are also guarded at runtime: if
  `try_init()` returns `None`, the test returns early so CI stays green.
- Integration path: `oxillama-runtime` can route matmul through the
  dispatcher when the `gpu` feature is enabled downstream, falling back to
  the CPU kernel transparently when `has_gpu()` returns `false`.
- Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K WGSL GPU kernels (CPU dequant + GPU f32 GEMV). Same
  dispatcher pattern as Q4_0 / Q8_0, extended for per-sub-block scales.
  Covers the three K-quants seen most often in HuggingFace repos.
- No `unwrap()` calls in any shipped source — every fallible call uses `?`,
  `ok_or_else`, or explicit `match` on the result.

## 5. Known Gaps / Incomplete

These items make up the remaining ~18 % of the v0.1.0 completion figure.

- ~~20 of 25 quant types have no GPU shader.~~ Stale — superseded by §2's
  own "24 / 25 quant types" line; kept here struck through rather than
  deleted so the history is visible. Verified 2026-08-05: all 24 types
  `GpuDispatcher::get_kernel` matches on do have working kernels (see
  `tests/cpu_gpu_cross_check.rs`, which cross-checks every one of them
  against the upstream-pinned CPU reference on real GPU hardware).
- ~~**Not wired into `oxillama-runtime` or `oxillama-cli`.** This crate is a
  complete, tested library with no caller: `oxillama-runtime`'s
  `Cargo.toml` does not depend on `oxillama-gpu`, and no CLI subcommand has
  a `--gpu` / `--n-gpu-layers` flag.~~ **Half-resolved in v0.1.4.**
  `oxillama-runtime` now depends on `oxillama-gpu` behind its own `gpu`
  feature; a new `gpu_backend` module (`GpuPolicy`/`GpuOptions`/`GpuStatus`)
  wired through `EngineConfig::gpu` dispatches exactly
  `Q4_0Resident::upload` at load time and `gemv_q4_0_resident` per token
  (see `kernels/q4_0_resident.rs`'s module doc) into single-token decode —
  matching the integration shape this bullet originally called for, for
  that one kernel. The other 23 quant-type GEMVs, tiled GEMM, fused
  attention and GPU sampling remain unreached (none measured faster than
  the CPU path on repeated calls, so nothing wires them in). `oxillama-cli`
  still has no `--gpu` flag — `gpu_policy_from_flags`/`print_gpu_banner`
  exist in `cli_args.rs` as unit-tested forward-prep but neither `run` nor
  `serve` defines the clap arguments yet, and `oxillama-py` has no
  constructor kwarg either. See the top-level `TODO.md`'s "GPU CLI/Python
  wiring" entry for the remaining half.
- **Every `gpu_gemv_*` function except the new
  `kernels::q4_0_resident::gemv_q4_0_resident` rebuilds its entire compute
  pipeline (`create_shader_module` → `create_bind_group_layout` →
  `create_pipeline_layout` → `create_compute_pipeline`) on *every call*,
  and dequantises weights on the CPU before re-uploading them as f32 (4×
  the quantised byte count) on every call too.** `GpuContext` gained a
  pipeline cache (`GpuContext::get_or_create_pipeline`) and
  `Q4_0Resident`/`gemv_q4_0_resident` demonstrate the fully fixed pattern
  (quantised bytes uploaded once, dequantised in-shader, pipeline cached) —
  measured ~9.8× faster than the legacy `Q4_0GpuKernel::gemv` path on a
  4096×4096 shape on real Apple M3 / Metal hardware. The other 23 kernel
  files still use the old per-call-rebuild pattern; converting them is
  mechanical (same shape as the Q4_0 conversion) but not yet done.
- No GEMM — only GEMV (aside from the tiled GEMM kernel below). Batched
  prompt processing and multi-query attention
  cannot use the GPU path at all. Prefill stays on CPU, which dominates
  time-to-first-token for any non-trivial prompt.
- ~~No batched GEMV either: a single query vector per dispatch. Multi-sample
  decoding sees no per-dispatch amortisation, so throughput saturates at
  roughly the per-token dispatch overhead.~~ ✅ Shipped: batched GEMV
  kernel (`batched_gemv_f32.wgsl` shader, `BatchedGemvConfig`,
  `BatchedGpuKernel` trait, Q4_0 batched impl).
- No naga cross-compile validation in CI. Shaders are only validated by
  running them on the host adapter; Metal MSL and Vulkan SPIR-V emission
  is not checked ahead of time, so a breakage could slip through.
- No f16 accumulator path. Everything accumulates in f32, which doubles
  the memory-bandwidth cost of the inner loop for fp16-safe ops.
- Kernels are naive: one workgroup per output row, no shared-memory tiling,
  no cooperative loading of the input vector. Occupancy and bandwidth
  utilisation are both well below the adapter's peak on every backend.
- No fused attention kernel. QK, softmax, and AV remain three separate
  dispatches with full round-trips through VRAM between stages.
- No multi-GPU dispatch. The dispatcher holds exactly one `GpuContext`,
  so tensor-parallel inference across multiple adapters is not possible.
- ~~No device-selection UI.~~ ✅ Device selection API shipped:
  `enumerate_devices`, `try_init_with_name`, `try_init_with_index`,
  `GpuDispatcher::with_device_name`, `GpuDispatcher::with_device_index`.

## 6. v1.1 Roadmap

- ~~WGSL shaders for Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K~~ ✅ Shipped.
- ~~Q1_0_G128 WGSL shader for bonsai parity.~~ ✅ Shipped (CPU dequant +
  GPU GEMV). Unlocks GPU-accelerated bonsai inference.
- ~~Batched GEMV: multiple input vectors per dispatch.~~ ✅ Shipped:
  `batched_gemv_f32.wgsl` shader, `BatchedGemvConfig`, `BatchedGpuKernel`
  trait, Q4_0 batched implementation. Amortises dispatch cost for prefill
  and multi-sample decoding.
- ~~f16 accumulator path for fp16-safe ops, gated at kernel selection time
  so accuracy-sensitive ops (softmax, norms) keep the f32 path.~~ ✅ Shipped: Q4_0 and Q8_0 GPU kernels check `supports_f16(ctx)` at dispatch time and branch to `dequant_q*_to_f16` + `f16_gemv` via the `gemv_f16.wgsl` shader; f32 path remains the fallback.
- ~~naga cross-compile validation in CI~~ ✅ Shipped: `tests/shader_validation.rs`
  parses all `src/shaders/*.wgsl` files and cross-compiles each to Metal MSL
  and Vulkan SPIR-V via naga. CI workflow at
  `.github/workflows/shader_validate.yml`.
- ~~Device selection API~~ ✅ Shipped: enumerate adapters,
  `try_init_with_name(&str)` and `try_init_with_index(usize)` constructors
  for `GpuContext`. `GpuDispatcher` exposes `with_device_name` and
  `with_device_index`.

## 7. v2.0+ Vision

- Tiled GEMM with workgroup shared memory — production-grade matmul, not
  the naive per-row GEMV shipped in v0.1.0. Required to make long-context
  prefill GPU-competitive against optimised CPU kernels.
- Full K-quant coverage (Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_K) with both
  GEMV and GEMM entry points, parameterised over the shared block layout.
- IQ4_XS as the first I-quant. By itself it covers a large share of modern
  HF quantisations; the remaining eight I-quants (IQ2_XXS/XS/S, IQ3_XXS/S,
  IQ4_NL, IQ5_K, IQ6_K) follow once the IQ4_XS template is proven.
- Fused attention kernel: QK, softmax, and AV in a single dispatch with
  shared memory between stages. Eliminates two VRAM round-trips per layer,
  which is where most small-batch decoding wall-time currently goes.
- Multi-GPU dispatch for tensor-parallel inference across adapters. The
  dispatcher gains a vector of contexts and a sharding policy; shader
  code is unchanged, only the host side coordinates the split.
- Metal argument-buffer optimisation for Apple-specific throughput gains.
  Bindless-style descriptor packing reduces CPU-side overhead per
  dispatch, which matters most for many-small-kernel workloads.
- CUDA path via wgpu's CUDA backend once and if that backend lands
  upstream. Keeps the Pure-Rust surface intact while unlocking
  NVIDIA-specific performance.
- WebGPU-specific optimisations for the browser — memory-access patterns
  tuned for tile-based mobile GPUs, coordinated with the `oxillama-wasm`
  hookup so a browser build gets real acceleration, not just portability.

## 11. Numerical-correctness pass (2026-08-05)

A sibling agent fixed seven quantisation formats' CPU kernels
(`oxillama-quant`) after finding their decoded layout disagreed with
upstream GGML (`llama.cpp/ggml/src/ggml-quants.c`). This crate's GPU
kernels had independently copied the same wrong layouts (and, in two cases
— Q4_K and Q6_K, not on the original seven-format list — had their *own*,
different wrong layout), so GPU inference silently produced different
numbers than CPU inference for any tensor using one of these formats.

- **Fixed in `oxillama-gpu`** (dequant helper + any hardcoded-layout unit
  tests updated to match): Q4_0, Q4_1, IQ4_NL, IQ4_XS, Q5_K, TQ1_0, TQ2_0
  (interleaved nibbles → split-half; a Q5_K `qh`/`qs` byte-order swap; TQ1_0's
  naive base-3 decode → upstream's fixed-point `ceil(q·256/243)` scheme and
  a separate multi-block column-aliasing bug; TQ2_0's digit-minor →
  digit-major order).
- **Also fixed, found via the new cross-check test below rather than the
  original handoff list**: Q4_K and Q6_K GPU kernels used a flat
  `qs[idx/2]`-style nibble mapping instead of upstream's group-based
  mapping — a materially different bug from the same class, caught because
  it produced 17%–296% relative error against the CPU oracle on real
  hardware with non-uniform random test data (measured across the 6
  mismatching rows: Q4_K 17%/82%, Q6_K 239%/296%/plus 2 more; not every row
  of every type failed, since some random blocks happen to hit near-equal
  outputs under both mappings).
- **New oracle**: `src/kernels/golden_tests.rs` — the same upstream-derived
  expected values as `oxillama-quant/tests/golden_vectors.rs`, asserted
  against this crate's own dequant helpers, so CPU and GPU are each pinned
  to upstream independently rather than to each other.
- **New cross-check**: `tests/cpu_gpu_cross_check.rs` — every one of the 24
  quant types `GpuDispatcher::get_kernel` supports, run on real GPU
  hardware, compared against `oxillama_quant::reference`. This is the test
  whose absence let the divergence ship in the first place; its lack of any
  history in this file until now is itself evidence of the gap.
- Also fixed: `crates/oxillama-wasm/src/webgpu.rs`'s embedded Q4_0 WGSL
  shader had the same interleaved-nibble defect, plus an independent
  `block_idx * 5u`-word-stride bug that only produced correct byte offsets
  for `block_idx == 0`. Both fixed; this shader is not currently dispatched
  from anywhere (`WebGpuContext::read_buffer` is a documented placeholder),
  so the fix is latent-correctness rather than an observed behaviour change.

## 12. GPU→runtime wiring and pipeline-caching (2026-08-05, wired 2026-08-16)

See §5's "Not wired into `oxillama-runtime` or `oxillama-cli`" and
"rebuilds its entire compute pipeline... on every call" bullets — those are
this pass's other two findings. `GpuContext::get_or_create_pipeline` (a
per-context pipeline cache) and `kernels/q4_0_resident.rs`
(`Q4_0Resident` + `gemv_q4_0_resident`: quantised-byte upload once,
in-shader dequantisation, cached pipeline) are the fix, demonstrated for
Q4_0 and measured ~9.8× faster than the legacy path on a 4096×4096 shape on
real Apple M3 / Metal hardware. The other 23 kernels still use the
rebuild-every-call pattern.

**Update (v0.1.4):** the `oxillama-runtime` half of "not wired" is now done —
`oxillama-runtime` depends on this crate behind its own `gpu` feature and a
new `gpu_backend` module dispatches `gemv_q4_0_resident` into single-token
decode via `EngineConfig::gpu`/`GpuPolicy`. `oxillama-cli` still has no
`--gpu` flag (only unit-tested forward-prep helpers in `cli_args.rs`), so
nothing reaches this from a shipped binary yet — see the top-level `TODO.md`'s
"GPU CLI/Python wiring" entry.

*Last updated: 2026-08-17 (v0.1.4 — GPU→runtime wiring landed via `oxillama-runtime`'s new `gpu_backend` module; 266 `--features gpu` tests)*

*Previously updated: 2026-05-05 (v0.1.3 shipped — GPU sampling kernels: softmax, top-k, categorical; 211 oxillama-gpu tests; ~95% completion)*

  - `topk_partition`: 256-thread workgroup, each thread tracks best candidate; thread-0 selection sort for final top-k (supports k ≤ 256).
  - `sample_categorical`: single-thread (1,1,1) workgroup; LCG RNG seeded from two u32 params; CDF walk to pick token.

## 8. Planned GPU Kernels (v2.0 — Scheduled 2026-04-19)

### B1 — Q2_K GPU kernel

- [x] Q2_K GPU kernel — CPU-dequant + GPU f32 GEMV (done 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** `Q2_KGpuKernel` implementing `GpuKernel::gemv`, dispatched for `GgufTensorType::Q2K`, correctness vs CPU reference (tolerance 1e-3).
  - **Design:** Follow `Q4_KGpuKernel` template. CPU-dequant weights via `Q2KRef::dequantize_block` → `Vec<f32>`, upload to GPU, dispatch `gemv_f32` shader, read back.
  - **Files:** `src/kernels/q2_k.rs` (new), `src/kernels/mod.rs`, `src/lib.rs`.
  - **Tests:** `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]` end-to-end correctness test; `if ctx.is_none() { return; }` guard for CI without GPU.
  - **Risk:** wgpu buffer alignment; pattern identical to Q4_K so low risk.

### B2 — Q3_K GPU kernel

- [x] Q3_K GPU kernel — CPU-dequant + GPU f32 GEMV (done 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** Symmetric to B1 for Q3_K.
  - **Design:** Wire `Q3KRef::dequantize_block` into same CPU-dequant-then-GPU-GEMV pattern.
  - **Files:** `src/kernels/q3_k.rs` (new), `src/kernels/mod.rs`, `src/lib.rs`.
  - **Tests:** Same template as B1.
  - **Risk:** Low.

### B3 — Q8_K GPU kernel

- [x] Q8_K GPU kernel — CPU-dequant + GPU f32 GEMV (done 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** Symmetric for Q8_K.
  - **Design:** Q8_K block = 256 signed 8-bit values × f16 scale. CPU-dequant then GPU GEMV.
  - **Files:** `src/kernels/q8_k.rs` (new), `src/kernels/mod.rs`, `src/lib.rs`.
  - **Tests:** Same template.
  - **Risk:** Low.

- [x] IQ4_XS GPU kernel — first I-quant GPU path; opens IQ2/IQ3 pipeline (done 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** `Iq4XsGpuKernel` — first I-quant GPU path; opens IQ2/IQ3 pipeline.
  - **Design:** IQ4_XS = 16-entry lookup grid + 4-bit indices. Wire `Iq4XsRef::dequantize_block` into CPU-dequant-then-GPU-GEMV. `gemv_f32` shader unchanged.
  - **Files:** `src/kernels/iq4_xs.rs` (new), `src/kernels/mod.rs`, `src/lib.rs`.
  - **Tests:** End-to-end correctness vs CPU reference on 64×256 block.
  - **Risk:** Low; same contract as K-quant GPU kernels.

## 9. Planned GPU Kernels (v2.0 — Scheduled 2026-04-19, Slice C)

### C1 — Tiled GEMM WGSL shader (planned 2026-04-19)

- [x] Tiled GEMM WGSL shader — production-grade GPU matmul replacing naive per-row path (done 2026-04-20)
  - **Goal:** Production-grade GPU matmul shader (`gemm_f32.wgsl`) with workgroup shared memory and cooperative tile loading. Replaces one-workgroup-per-output-row naïve path for K >= 64. Target: ~3–5× over naïve path on Apple M3 Max.
  - **Design:** Tile sizes: `TILE_M=32, TILE_N=32, TILE_K=16`. Workgroup: `@workgroup_size(16,16)` — 256 threads. Shared memory: `var<workgroup> A_tile: array<f32, TILE_M * TILE_K>; var<workgroup> B_tile: array<f32, TILE_K * TILE_N>;`. Loop: workgroupBarrier → cooperative load A+B tiles (each thread loads 1 elem) → workgroupBarrier → accumulate `C[m,n] += A_tile[m,k]*B_tile[k,n]` over k. Rust: `TiledGemmKernel` implementing `GpuKernel::gemm` trait method. Edge tiles: guards + write zeros when out of bounds.
  - **Files:** `src/shaders/gemm_f32.wgsl` (new); `src/kernels/tiled_gemm.rs` (new, ~300 LoC); `src/lib.rs` (register gemm trait method + dispatch).
  - **Tests:** (a) `tiled_gemm_matches_cpu_32x32x32` tol 1e-3; (b) `tiled_gemm_matches_cpu_256x256x256` tol 1e-3; (c) `tiled_gemm_non_multiple_of_tile` (33×65×17) tol 1e-3.
  - **Risk:** Edge-tile handling; workgroupBarrier() placement.

- [x] Fused attention WGSL kernel — QK + softmax + AV in single dispatch (done 2026-04-20)
  - **Goal:** `attention_fused_f32.wgsl` shader: QK + softmax + AV in single dispatch with shared memory. GPU counterpart to CPU FlashAttention. Eliminates two VRAM round-trips per attention layer.
  - **Design:** One workgroup per Q row × full K,V. Shared: `K_tile[TILE_K × head_dim]`, `V_tile[TILE_K × head_dim]`, `scores[TILE_K]`. Online softmax in registers: m, ℓ, o per thread. For each K tile: cooperative load K,V → shared; compute `S[k] = dot(q_row, K_tile[k,:]) * scale`; causal mask; m_new = max(m, max(S)); P[k] = exp(S[k]-m_new); ℓ_new = exp(m-m_new)*ℓ + sum(P); o = exp(m-m_new)*o + sum_k(P[k]*V_tile[k,:]); update m,ℓ. Final: o /= ℓ.
  - **Files:** `src/shaders/attention_fused_f32.wgsl` (new, ~150 LoC WGSL); `src/kernels/fused_attention.rs` (new, ~400 LoC Rust); `src/lib.rs` (export).
  - **Tests:** (a) `fused_attention_matches_cpu_causal` — 1 head, 32 head_dim, 64×64 QK, tol 1e-3; (b) `fused_attention_matches_cpu_long` — 256×1024, tol 1e-3; (c) `fused_attention_decode_single_q` — 1×1024, tol 1e-3.
  - **Risk:** Online softmax rounding at long seqs — 1e-3 tolerance intentional. workgroupBarrier() before reading shared tile, after writing.

### C3 — IQ2_XXS GPU GEMV kernel (planned 2026-04-19)

- [x] IQ2_XXS GPU GEMV kernel — CPU-dequant + GPU f32 GEMV (done 2026-04-20)
  - **Goal:** `Iq2XxsGpuKernel` for `GgufTensorType::Iq2Xxs`; CPU-dequant then `gemv_f32.wgsl`.
  - **Design:** IQ2_XXS block = 66 bytes, 256 weights via 256-entry lookup grid. Follow IQ4_XS template from v0.1.1. Inline the block layout from `oxillama-quant/src/reference/iq2_xxs.rs` (oxillama-quant is not a GPU crate dep).
  - **Files:** `src/kernels/iq2_xxs.rs` (new, ~400 LoC); `src/kernels/mod.rs`; `src/lib.rs` (dispatcher arm).
  - **Tests:** `test_gpu_gemv_iq2_xxs_matches_cpu` — 64×256 GEMV, tol 1e-3.
  - **Risk:** Lookup-grid constants must match upstream exactly — cross-reference `reference/iq2_xxs.rs` byte-for-byte.

### C4 — IQ2_S GPU GEMV kernel (planned 2026-04-19)

- [x] IQ2_S GPU GEMV kernel — sibling of C3 for IQ2_S (done 2026-04-20)

  - **Files:** `src/kernels/iq2_s.rs` (new); `src/kernels/mod.rs`; `src/lib.rs`.
  - **Tests:** `test_gpu_gemv_iq2_s_matches_cpu` — 64×256 GEMV, tol 1e-3.
  - **Risk:** Sign-bit decode order — cross-reference reference impl.

### C5 — IQ3_XXS GPU GEMV kernel (planned 2026-04-19)

  - **Tests:** `test_gpu_gemv_iq3_xxs_matches_cpu` — 64×256 GEMV, tol 1e-3.

### C6 — IQ3_S GPU GEMV kernel (planned 2026-04-19)

- [x] IQ3_S GPU GEMV kernel — most complex I-quant in this slice (done 2026-04-20)
  - **Goal:** GPU GEMV for IQ3_S. Most-complex I-quant in this slice.
  - **Design:** IQ3_S block = 110 bytes, 256 weights with 3-bit low + high bits, sign nibbles. Inline decode from `reference/iq3_s.rs` — cross-reference twice.
  - **Files:** `src/kernels/iq3_s.rs` (new); `src/kernels/mod.rs`; `src/lib.rs`.
  - **Tests:** `test_gpu_gemv_iq3_s_matches_cpu` — 64×256 GEMV, tol 1e-3.
  - **Risk:** IQ3_S decode is the most byte-fiddly — cross-reference reference impl twice before coding.
