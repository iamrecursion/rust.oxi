/// Wait for a shutdown signal (Ctrl-C / SIGTERM).
///
/// Resolves once when the first signal arrives. The returned future is
/// designed to be passed to `axum::serve(..).with_graceful_shutdown()`.
///
/// On Unix, both SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and SIGTERM are handled.
/// On non-Unix (Windows), only Ctrl-C is available.
///
/// D12 fix: if installing a signal handler fails (this can happen — e.g.
/// another handler is already registered, or the platform denies it), this
/// used to `.expect(...)`, aborting the entire async runtime — which is a
/// far worse outcome than simply not being able to shut down gracefully
/// via that particular signal. It now logs the failure and falls back to
/// `future::pending()` for that branch, so the *other* signal (or an
/// external `kill -9`) still works, and a single failed installation
/// cannot take down an otherwise-healthy server.
