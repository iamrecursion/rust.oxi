//! Hessian-vector product and mixed-partial back ends for [`HigherOrderEngine`].
//!
//! # Why these are finite differences, and why that is not a stub
//!
//! [`HigherOrderEngine`] consumes an objective as a black-box
//! `impl Fn(&Array1<T>) -> T` that is *monomorphic in `T`*. Nested automatic
//! differentiation (forward-over-reverse, reverse-over-forward) fundamentally
//! cannot be threaded through that type:
//!
//! * forward mode needs the objective to accept dual numbers, i.e. to be
//!   generic (`Fn(&Array1<D>) -> D` for any dual `D`), and
//! * reverse mode needs the objective expressed as tape operations
//!   ([`crate::reverse_mode::ReverseModeEngine`]), not as an opaque closure.
//!
//! `optirs-learned` has real implementations of both
//! ([`crate::forward_mode`], [`crate::reverse_mode`]) — they simply require a
//! different entry point than a `Fn(&Array1<T>) -> T`.
//!
//! So this module does two honest things instead of one dishonest one. Every
//! mode that *can* exist behind this signature is implemented as a genuinely
//! distinct numerical algorithm with its own cost and truncation error, and
//! [`HvpMode::NestedAutodiff`] / [`MixedPartialMethod::NestedAutodiff`] return a
//! typed error naming the reason and the alternative, rather than silently
//! running a finite difference under an autodiff name.
//!
//! Historically (finding F89) `hvp_reverse_over_forward` and
//! `hvp_finite_difference` were byte-identical, `hvp_forward_over_reverse` was a
//! third copy behind a helper, and all three of
//! `mixed_partial_{forward_over_reverse, reverse_over_forward, pure_forward}`
//! contained a one-line delegation to the finite-difference routine with the
//! comment "Real implementation would use proper forward-over-reverse mode" —
//! five advertised differentiation modes for one algorithm.
