# OptiRS Learned TODO (v0.3.3)

## Module Status: Research-Grade (Pre-1.0)

**Tests**: 565 tests (library + integration, `cargo nextest run -p optirs-learned
--all-features`) + 3 doc tests, all passing
**Feature flags**: `transformer`, `lstm`, `meta_learning` (all on by default; each genuinely
gates its modules - see `src/lib.rs`)
**SciRS2 Compliance**: 100% (no direct `ndarray`/`rand` dependency; see `Cargo.toml`)

### Domain-Specific Optimization
- [x] Computer vision specific optimizers (CVOptimizer)
- [x] NLP-specific token-aware updates (NLPOptimizer)
- [x] Attention pattern optimization (AttentionOptimizer)

### Online Learning and Adaptation
- [x] Continual learning (EWC, Progressive Networks)
- [x] Online MAML for continuous task streams (staleness decay, buffer management, adaptation efficiency)
- [x] Real-time adaptation mechanisms (`src/realtime_adaptation.rs` — online EWMA + two-sided CUSUM drift detection on loss & grad-norm streams driving an AIMD learning-rate / momentum controller with plateau detection, clamping, and cooldown; 22 tests) (2026-06-24)

### Advanced Architectures
- [x] Graph Neural Network optimizers (`src/gnn_optimizer.rs` — message-passing GNN over the parameter/layer graph: node gradient features, edge messages, GRU node update, readout → per-parameter update; Chain / FullyConnected / KNearest topologies; impl `AdvancedOptimizer<T>`; 14 tests) (2026-06-24). Evolution-strategies meta-training of the GRU weights via `MetaTrainable` (`src/gnn_optimizer/meta_training.rs`; 6 tests) closes the gap where those weights were previously drawn once from the seed and never updated (2026-08-18)
- [x] Memory-augmented optimizers (NTM) (`src/ntm_optimizer.rs` — full Graves-2014 addressing: content `softmax(β·cosine)` → interpolation → circular-convolution shift → sharpening, erase+add writes, feed-forward controller; impl `AdvancedOptimizer<T>`; 20 tests) (2026-06-24). Evolution-strategies meta-training of the controller weights via `MetaTrainable` (`src/ntm_optimizer/meta_training.rs`; 5 tests) closes the gap where those weights were previously drawn once from the seed and never updated (2026-08-18)
- [x] Episodic memory systems (EpisodicMemoryBank, SupportSetManager)

### Multi-Task and Transfer
- [x] Cross-domain knowledge transfer (domain registration, similarity, transferability matrix)
- [x] Shared representation learning (shared representation updates)
- [x] Zero-shot optimization (`src/zero_shot.rs` — 9 gradient/landscape meta-features → multinomial-logistic optimizer classifier + linear log-learning-rate regressor; offline meta-fit, no per-task training; 18 tests) (2026-06-24)
- [x] Few-shot adaptation strategies (PrototypicalNetwork, FastAdaptationEngine, TaskSimilarityCalculator)

### Research Features
- [x] NAS for optimizer architectures (DARTS) (`src/darts_optimizer_search.rs` — softmax architecture weights α over update primitives (grad / momentum / RMSprop / sign / Adam-like / weight-decay), closed-form α-gradient bilevel alternation, discretization to the final optimizer; 14 tests) (2026-06-24)
- [x] Quantum-inspired optimizers (`src/quantum_learned.rs` — `QuantumLearnedOptimizer` adapter exposing core `QuantumAnnealing` / `HybridQuantumClassical` through `AdvancedOptimizer<T>`; 16 tests) (2026-06-24)
- [x] Variational quantum optimizer (`src/quantum_learned.rs` — `QuantumBackend::Variational` wrapping core `VariationalQuantumOptimizer` (SPSA) behind `AdvancedOptimizer<T>`) (2026-06-24)

## Testing Status

### Coverage
- [x] Neural optimizer architecture tests
- [x] Meta-learning algorithm tests
- [x] Memory system tests
- [x] Attention mechanism tests
- [x] State management tests

### Test Count
```
565 tests passing (library + integration, cargo nextest run -p optirs-learned --all-features)
3 doc tests passing
```
Re-measure with the commands above before quoting a count elsewhere - hardcoded numbers go
stale quickly.

## Status Summary

- Learned optimizer framework operational (Transformer, LSTM, GNN, NTM)
- Meta-learning pipeline (MAML, Reptile, Meta-SGD) implemented and tested
- Evaluation metrics (AUC, accuracy, confidence, convergence speed, ...) are computed from
  real per-run measurements, not hardcoded constants
- Wave 2: Few-shot learning, episodic memory, online MAML, cross-domain transfer

**Status**: Research-grade - APIs may still change between 0.x releases; benchmark against
`optirs-core`'s hand-designed optimizers before depending on a learned one in production
**Version**: v0.3.3
