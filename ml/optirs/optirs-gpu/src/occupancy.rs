//! CUDA Occupancy Calculator (CPU-side, analytical).
//!
//! This module implements the standard NVIDIA *occupancy* model: given a
//! kernel's per-thread/per-block resource usage and the architectural limits of
//! a streaming multiprocessor (SM), it computes how many thread blocks and warps
//! can be co-resident on a single SM, the resulting *occupancy* (the ratio of
//! resident warps to the hardware maximum), and which resource is the binding
//! constraint. It also provides an [`optimal_block_size`] search analogous to
//! `cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize`.
//!
//! Nothing here queries a GPU — every value is derived from documented
//! architectural constants and integer arithmetic, so the calculator is
//! deterministic and works on any host.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! For a block of `threads_per_block` threads on an SM with `warp_size` threads
//! per warp:
//!
//! ```text
//! warps_per_block      = ceil(threads_per_block / warp_size)
//! blocks_by_warps      = max_warps_per_sm / warps_per_block
//! blocks_by_registers  = registers_per_sm
//!                        / round_up(registers_per_thread * threads_per_block,
//!                                   register_alloc_granularity)
//! blocks_by_shared_mem = shared_mem_per_sm / shared_mem_per_block
//! blocks_by_cap        = max_blocks_per_sm
//!
//! active_blocks = min(blocks_by_warps, blocks_by_registers,
//!                     blocks_by_shared_mem, blocks_by_cap)
//! active_warps  = active_blocks * warps_per_block
//! occupancy     = active_warps / max_warps_per_sm
//! ```
//!
//! The register term uses a *per-block* allocation rounded up to
//! `register_alloc_granularity` (256 32-bit registers on every architecture
//! modelled here). This is a deliberately simple approximation of the hardware's
//! per-warp register allocation; for block sizes that are whole multiples of the
//! warp size (the common case) it coincides with the per-warp model.
//!
//! A `registers_per_thread` of `0` is treated as "no register pressure"
//! (unlimited), and a `shared_mem_per_block` of `0` is treated as "no shared
//! memory pressure" (unlimited), so those resources never bound occupancy.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use optirs_gpu::{calculate_occupancy, KernelResourceUsage, SmResourceLimits};
//!
//! let limits = SmResourceLimits::sm_80();
//! let usage = KernelResourceUsage::new(32, 0, 256);
//! let result = calculate_occupancy(&usage, &limits).expect("valid configuration");
//! assert_eq!(result.active_blocks_per_sm, 8);
//! assert!((result.occupancy - 1.0).abs() < 1e-9);
//! ```
