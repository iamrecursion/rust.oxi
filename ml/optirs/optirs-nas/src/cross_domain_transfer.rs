//! Cross-domain knowledge transfer for Neural Architecture Search.
//!
//! This module sits on top of [`ArchitectureKnowledgeGraph`] (the persisted
//! catalogue of previously-evaluated architectures) and provides a higher
//! level API for *transferring* knowledge from a richly-explored source
//! domain into a new, less-explored target domain.
//!
//! The core abstraction is [`CrossDomainTransferEngine`], which combines:
//!
//! 1. **Domain similarity** — how close are two domains in embedding space?
//! 2. **Per-architecture transferability** — which specific source
//!    architectures are good warm-starts for the target query?
//! 3. **Warm-start embeddings** — a single performance-weighted embedding
//!    that summarises the best of the source domain and can be used as the
//!    initial query for the target NAS run.
//! 4. **Transfer subgraphs** — a freshly-assembled
//!    [`ArchitectureKnowledgeGraph`] containing only the recommended source
//!    architectures wired to a synthetic target placeholder via `Transfers`
//!    edges, ready to be persisted alongside the new search.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```

//! let mut graph = ArchitectureKnowledgeGraph::new();

//!     .unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Mathematical notes
//!
//! All similarity metrics return a value in `[0, 1]`. Raw cosine values are
//! clipped to `[0, 1]` (negative correlation is treated as "no transferable
//! similarity"). The Wasserstein metric uses a one-step nearest-neighbour
//! approximation in cosine space, which is a coarse but cheap surrogate for
//! the true 1-Wasserstein distance and is sufficient for ranking.
