// Comprehensive metrics and monitoring for streaming optimization

// This module provides detailed performance metrics, monitoring capabilities,
// and analytics for streaming optimization systems.

// Honesty contract for this module (findings M1-M4): every field below is
// either derived from data the caller actually supplied, or it is an
// `Option` that stays `None` until a caller feeds the missing measurement
// through one of the `record_*`/`set_*` hooks. No field is ever populated
// with an invented constant.
