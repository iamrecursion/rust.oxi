// Secure Aggregation Module
//
// Bonawitz-style secure aggregation for federated learning: clients mask their
// updates with pairwise secrets agreed by X25519 key exchange, upload the
// masked values, and the server -- which holds no key material at all -- adds
// the uploads together. The masks cancel exactly, so the server learns the
// cohort's sum and nothing about any individual update.
//
// What was wrong before
// ---------------------
// The previous revision of this file was not a weakened protocol, it was the
// inverse of one:
//
//   * `prepare_round` generated *every client's mask on the server*
//     (`Random::default()` inside the server loop) and stored them in a
//     server-side map. A server that knows all the masks can subtract any one
//     of them from the matching upload, so confidentiality was exactly zero.
//   * The masks were drawn from `-1.0..1.0` and simply *added* to each update
//     during aggregation, then never removed. They therefore did not cancel:
//     the "aggregate" was the mean of the updates plus the mean of a pile of
//     random noise, i.e. neither private nor correct.
//   * `prepare_round` panicked on a poisoned lock (`.expect("lock poisoned")`)
//     over a mutex guarding nothing but a monotone counter.
//
// The current implementation moves all key material and all mask generation to
// the clients (see [`super::pairwise_masking`]), leaves the server with
// modular addition, and replaces the mutex-guarded counter with a per-round
// salt drawn from operating-system entropy -- so the poisoning failure mode no
// longer exists rather than being handled.
//
// Threat model, stated honestly
// -----------------------------
// What this provides: an honest-but-curious server that does not collude with
// any client learns only the sum of the received updates. Confidentiality of
// an individual update holds as long as at least two clients in the round keep
// their secret keys, since the mask of a client is the sum of its pairwise
// masks with all peers.
//
// What it does not provide:
//   * No self-mask. Bonawitz's full protocol adds a per-client mask `b_i`
//     shared out via Shamir secret sharing, which defends against a server
//     that declares a client dropped, collects the pairwise-mask disclosures,
//     and *then* processes that client's delayed upload. This implementation
//     instead closes the same hole procedurally: once a client is marked
//     dropped its upload is refused (see [`SecureAggregator::receive`]), and a
//     client that has submitted cannot be marked dropped.
//   * No malicious-server verification. A server that lies about the
//     public-key directory (a man-in-the-middle on the key distribution step)
//     can learn individual updates. Deployments must authenticate the
//     directory out of band.
//   * No differential privacy. Secure aggregation hides individual updates
//     from the server; it says nothing about what the *sum* reveals. Compose
//     it with the differential privacy machinery in [`crate::privacy`] for
//     that; `SecureAggregationConfig::aggregate_dp` is rejected here rather
//     than silently pretending to supply it.
