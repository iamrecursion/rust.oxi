// Configuration structures for federated privacy algorithms
//
// # 0.3.2 changes
//
// * [`FederatedPrivacyConfig::validate`] was added (see the `validation`
//   module) and is called from `FederatedPrivacyCoordinator::new`, so an
//   invalid federation can no longer be constructed. Configurations that used
//   to be accepted silently -- `target_epsilon: -1.0`, `noise_multiplier: 0.0`,
//   `clients_per_round > total_clients` -- are now rejected.
// * Two defaults were corrected because they advertised a guarantee that no
//   code path delivered: `CommunicationPrivacyConfig::encryption_enabled` and
//   `SecureAggregationConfig::aggregate_dp` now default to `false`, and
//   `AmplificationConfig::multi_round_amplification` likewise. Setting any of
//   them explicitly is refused by `validate()` with an error naming what is
//   missing, rather than being ignored.
// * **`FederatedPrivacyConfig::default()` raises `noise_multiplier` from the
//   DP-SGD default of 1.1 to 4.0.** A federated round is one subsampled-Gaussian
//   release over 10% of the federation, not one minibatch step: at sigma = 1.1
//   the moments accountant charges 2.25 epsilon for the *first* round against a
//   default budget of 1.0, so `FederatedPrivacyCoordinator::start_federated_round`
//   failed closed before it had run once. This is a real behaviour change for
//   anyone relying on the default -- rounds now succeed, and each costs about
//   0.22 epsilon instead of being rejected. Callers who want the old multiplier
//   must set `base_config.noise_multiplier` explicitly and accept that the
//   default epsilon budget will not cover a single round.
// * Duplicated configuration types were removed in favour of the ones the audited
//   implementations in `privacy::federated` actually consume; see the `pub use`
//   re-exports below.
