# OptiRS Bench TODO (v0.3.3)

## Module Status: Production Ready

**Tests**: 460 tests passing (`cargo nextest run -p optirs-bench --all-features`)
**Features**: Statistical benchmarking, Memory profiling, Regression detection
**SciRS2-Core usage**: array/numeric backend (`scirs2_core::ndarray`, `scirs2_core::numeric::Float`)
throughout, per COOLJAPAN policy. The crate's benchmarking/profiling/metrics/regression
logic itself is native to this crate, not a wrapper over a `scirs2_core::benchmarking`-style
module (no such dependency is used).

## Completed: Core Benchmarking Infrastructure

### Benchmark Framework
- [x] Criterion.rs integration for statistical benchmarking
- [x] Custom benchmark harness for optimization-specific metrics
- [x] Multi-threaded benchmark execution
- [x] Memory usage measurement
- [x] Cross-platform timing accuracy
- [x] Benchmark result serialization

### Performance Metrics
- [x] Throughput measurement (ops/sec)
- [x] Latency profiling (step timing)
- [x] Convergence rate tracking
- [x] Memory efficiency metrics
- [x] CPU utilization monitoring

### Command-Line Tools
- [x] Baseline-vs-candidate comparison (`optirs-bench analyze`, `OptimizerComparison`)
- [x] Output format options across the 10 binaries (Markdown/plain-text/CSV in
      `optirs-bench report`; JSON/YAML/HTML/Markdown in the security/leak-report tools)
- [ ] Dataset-specific benchmark suites -- not implemented; `OptimizerBenchmark` only
      ships the 3 built-in synthetic test functions (Quadratic, Rosenbrock, Sphere)
- [ ] Hardware-specific optimization -- not implemented; see Resource Utilization above
- [ ] Progress reporting during a run -- not implemented; results print only after
      `run_benchmark` returns

### Regression Detection
- [x] Statistical significance testing (t-test, Mann-Whitney U)
- [x] Effect size calculation (Cohen's d)
- [x] Trend analysis
- [x] Automated alerting system
- [x] Git integration for commit-based analysis
- [x] Performance baseline management

### Memory Profiling
- [x] Heap allocation tracking
- [x] Memory leak detection algorithms
- [x] Memory usage visualization
- [x] Memory fragmentation detection

### Security Auditing
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] Code security analysis
- [x] Plugin security verification
- [x] Input validation testing

---

## Completed: Advanced Features

### System Resource Monitoring
- [x] CPU usage tracking
- [x] Memory usage monitoring (RSS, VSZ, heap)
- [x] Disk I/O tracking

### Comparative Analysis
- [x] Statistical comparison framework
- [x] Visualization generation
- [x] Performance ranking algorithms
- [x] Multi-dimensional comparison

### CI/CD Integration
- [x] GitHub Actions integration
- [x] Jenkins plugin support
- [x] GitLab CI integration
- [x] Azure DevOps integration
- [x] Custom webhook support

## Future Work (v0.4.0+)

### Advanced Analytics
- [x] Performance prediction models (`src/performance_prediction.rs` — LinearRegressionPredictor / RidgeRegressionPredictor / KNearestPredictor with shared `PerformancePredictor` trait, Gauss-Jordan inversion, feature normalization, train_test_split, R²/MAE/RMSE metrics; 20 tests)
- [x] Anomaly detection with ML (`src/anomaly_detection.rs` — ZScoreDetector / IqrDetector / ModifiedZScoreDetector / IsolationForestDetector with severity classification and `AnomalyDetector` trait; 28 tests)
- [x] Performance pattern recognition (`src/performance_pattern_recognition.rs` — matrix-profile motif discovery, CUSUM and Page-Hinkley changepoint detection, binary-segmentation regime detection, trend classification; 28 tests)
- [x] Performance forecast modeling (`src/performance_forecast.rs` — MovingAverage / ExponentialSmoothing / HoltLinear / HoltWinters forecasters with confidence intervals, autocorrelation-based seasonality detection; 27 tests)

### Report Generation
- [x] Executive summary reports (`src/report_templates.rs` — `ReportTemplate` engine with executive-summary generation over `BenchmarkReport` / `OptimizerComparison` / `OptimizerPerformance`; 9 tests) (2026-06-24)
- [x] Customizable report templates (`src/report_templates.rs` — Markdown / PlainText / CSV renderers, run-details & trajectory-summary sections, `save_report`) (2026-06-24)

## Out of scope for autonomous implementation

These require external systems / UIs / OS profilers and are intentionally NOT auto-implemented — they need a web stack, a PDF layout engine, or platform-specific kernel tracing, not pure-Rust CPU logic (faking them would invent behavior):

### Visualization (web / UI stack)
- [ ] Interactive web dashboards
- [ ] Real-time performance monitoring
- [ ] Historical trend visualization
- [ ] Custom dashboard configuration

### Report Generation (external engine)
- [ ] PDF report generation (needs a PDF layout engine)

### Platform-Specific profilers (OS / kernel APIs)
- [ ] Linux perf integration
- [ ] eBPF-based profiling
- [ ] macOS Instruments integration
- [ ] Windows ETW integration

---

## Testing Status

### Coverage
- [x] Unit tests for all benchmarking components
- [x] Integration tests for CLI tools
- [x] Performance regression tests
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility tests
- [x] Security testing

### Test Count
```
460 tests passing
```
(`cargo nextest run -p optirs-bench --all-features`; re-measure rather than trusting this
number as the crate grows -- it will go stale again.)
