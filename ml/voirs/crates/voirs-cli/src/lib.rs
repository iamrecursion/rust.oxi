//! # VoiRS CLI
//!
//! Command-line interface for VoiRS speech synthesis framework.
//! Provides easy-to-use commands for synthesis, voice management, and more.

// Allow pedantic lints that are acceptable for audio/DSP processing code
#![allow(clippy::cast_precision_loss)] // Acceptable for audio sample conversions
#![allow(clippy::cast_possible_truncation)] // Controlled truncation in audio processing
#![allow(clippy::cast_sign_loss)] // Intentional in index calculations
#![allow(clippy::missing_errors_doc)] // Many internal functions with self-documenting error types
#![allow(clippy::missing_panics_doc)] // Panics are documented where relevant
#![allow(clippy::unused_self)] // Some trait implementations require &self for consistency
#![allow(clippy::must_use_candidate)] // Not all return values need must_use annotation
#![allow(clippy::doc_markdown)] // Technical terms don't all need backticks
#![allow(clippy::unnecessary_wraps)] // Result wrappers maintained for API consistency
#![allow(clippy::float_cmp)] // Exact float comparisons are intentional in some contexts
#![allow(clippy::match_same_arms)] // Pattern matching clarity sometimes requires duplication
#![allow(clippy::module_name_repetitions)] // Type names often repeat module names
#![allow(clippy::struct_excessive_bools)] // Config structs naturally have many boolean flags
#![allow(clippy::too_many_lines)] // Some functions are inherently complex
#![allow(clippy::needless_pass_by_value)] // Some functions designed for ownership transfer
#![allow(clippy::similar_names)] // Many similar variable names in algorithms
#![allow(clippy::unused_async)] // Public API functions may need async for consistency
#![allow(clippy::needless_range_loop)] // Range loops sometimes clearer than iterators
#![allow(clippy::uninlined_format_args)] // Explicit argument names can improve clarity

#![allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)] // Some functions naturally need many parameters
#![allow(clippy::field_reassign_with_default)] // Sometimes clearer than builder pattern
