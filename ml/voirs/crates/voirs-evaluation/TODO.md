## Session 2026-04-27

- ✅ `QualityRegressionDetector`: new `src/quality/quality_regression.rs` — wraps `RegressionDetector` with optional PESQ/STOI/MCD evaluators; MCD stored as `-mcd` internally (higher MCD = positive change = regression); async `evaluate_and_record`; `save_baseline`/`load_baseline` via JSON snapshot; `generate_report`; 5 inline tests pass (922/922 suite).
