//! Metric reliability and reproducibility testing framework
//!
//! This module provides testing of metric reliability and reproducibility
//! including test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, internal consistency,
//! and reproducibility across different conditions.
//!
//! # Honesty notes
//!
//! Every sub-test in this module evaluates the **real audio** referenced by each
//! [`GroundTruthSample`]'s `audio_path`/`reference_path` (loaded via
//! [`crate::audio::AudioLoader`]), not a fixed placeholder buffer — a metric
//! evaluated on a fabricated constant signal cannot tell you anything about that
//! metric's real-world reliability.
//!
//! "Inter-rater" reliability here means something specific and honestly
//! documented: this crate has exactly one quality evaluator, so there are no
//! independent human or algorithmic raters to compare. Instead, the "raters"
//! are the evaluator run under genuinely different [`QualityEvaluationConfig`]
//! metric selections (a real, meaningful source of measurement variation for a
//! multi-metric evaluator) — see [`MetricReliabilityTester::test_inter_rater_reliability`]
//! for the precise definition. Sub-tests that would require infrastructure this
//! crate does not have (independent cross-platform CI runners, a second
//! reference implementation, physical environmental control) fail closed with
//! [`ReliabilityTestError::NotSupported`] rather than returning invented numbers;
//! see [`MetricReliabilityTester::test_reproducibility`].
