//! Singing synthesis engine and processing
//!
//! This module has been refactored into smaller, more manageable components
//! for better maintainability and organization. It provides comprehensive
//! singing voice synthesis capabilities including harmonic synthesis,
//! spectral processing, and noise generation.
