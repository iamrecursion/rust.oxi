## 🔧 Technical Implementation Notes

### SIMD Optimization Guidelines
```rust
// Use scirs2_core SIMD abstractions
use scirs2_core::simd_ops::SimdUnifiedOps;

// Example: Vectorized pitch interpolation
fn interpolate_simd(points: &[f32], count: usize) -> Vec<f32> {
    // Use SIMD-friendly algorithms
    // Leverage platform-specific optimizations
    // Maintain numerical accuracy
}
```

### Testing Best Practices
```rust
// Stress test template
#[test]
#[ignore] // Run with --ignored for stress tests
fn stress_test_extreme_complexity() {
    // Create extreme conditions
    // Measure performance under load
    // Validate graceful degradation
    // Check memory stability
}
```

### Research Integration Pattern
```rust
// Modular research model integration
pub trait ResearchModel {
    fn synthesize(&self, input: &ModelInput) -> Result<Vec<f32>>;
    fn quality_score(&self) -> f32;
    fn inference_time(&self) -> Duration;
}

// Easy A/B testing
impl SynthesisEngine {
    pub fn with_research_model(&mut self, model: Box<dyn ResearchModel>) {
        self.research_models.push(model);
    }
}
```
