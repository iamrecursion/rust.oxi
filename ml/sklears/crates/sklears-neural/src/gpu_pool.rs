//! GPU memory-pool telemetry and (when the `gpu` feature is enabled) a real
//! pooled allocator built on `oxicuda-memory`'s stream-ordered `MemoryPool`.
//!
//! [`PoolTelemetry`] is pure, hardware-independent bookkeeping: a handful of
//! atomic counters and two derived ratios (`hit_rate`, `used_fraction`). It
//! has no CUDA/driver dependency and is unit-tested unconditionally (see the
//! `tests` module below), unlike everything else in this crate's `gpu`
//! module, which needs a real device to exercise meaningfully.
//!
//! [`GpuMemoryPool`] (feature = "gpu") is the real allocator: it wraps
//! `oxicuda_memory::MemoryPool` (itself a stream-ordered pool over
//! `cuMemAlloc_v2`/`cuMemFree_v2`) with an application-level free-list of
//! [`PooledHandle`]s so that [`PoolTelemetry::record_hit`]/`record_miss`
//! reflect *this* pool's own reuse decisions precisely: a hit means "we handed
//! back a buffer we were already holding, with no new device allocation call
//! at all," not an estimate or a guess about what the underlying driver did
//! internally.
//!
//! # Why a handle instead of returning `PooledBuffer<T>` directly
//!
//! `oxicuda_memory::PooledBuffer<T>::drop` unconditionally returns its
//! allocation to the *underlying* `MemoryPool`'s own internal free-bins
//! (gated on a stream-ordered recycle event) -- it has no hook for a caller
//! to intercept. That underlying reuse is real, but it is invisible from the
//! outside: nothing in `oxicuda-memory`'s public API reports whether a given
//! `alloc_async` call was actually served from a free bin or required a fresh
//! `cuMemAlloc_v2`. Fabricating a hit/miss split from that opaque signal
//! would violate the "no fabricated telemetry" goal this module exists to
//! fix. [`PooledHandle`] instead keeps the `PooledBuffer<T>` alive in *this*
//! pool's own free-list on drop (see its `Drop` impl), so a hit is something
//! this module can prove: "no `alloc_async` call happened for this
//! acquisition."

// This whole module is gated behind the `gpu` feature at its `mod gpu_pool;`
// declaration in `lib.rs` (there is no pooled-allocator concept at all
// without real GPU support compiled in), so nothing in this file needs its
// own repeated `#[cfg(feature = "gpu")]`.
