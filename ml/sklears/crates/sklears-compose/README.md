## Overview

`sklears-compose` implements pipelines, column transformers, target transformers, and composite estimator utilities matching scikit-learn’s compose module.

## Key Features

- **Pipelines**: Type-safe, state-aware `Pipeline` and `FeatureUnion` implementations, composed from boxed `PipelineStep`/`PipelinePredictor` trait objects. Note: `FeatureUnion`'s `n_jobs` config field is not yet read anywhere in the fit path (no working parallel execution behind it today).
- **Column Transforms**: `ColumnTransformer` selects and concatenates column subsets (`"passthrough"`/`"drop"` plus a `remainder` policy). **Known gap**: attaching a custom per-column transformer instance (via the builder's `.transformer(name, columns)` or via `add_transformer_step`) does not yet wire the supplied transformer into the fitted pipeline — any name other than `"passthrough"`/`"drop"` silently falls back to a passthrough at fit time. See `TODO.md`.
- **Target Transformations**: TransformedTargetRegressor, inverse-transform aware scorers, and custom adapters.
- **Serialization**: Friendly with serde-powered persistence and Python interoperability via `sklears-python`.
- **Stacking**: `stacking::StackingEnsemble` performs genuine out-of-fold k-fold stacked generalization (leakage-safe meta-features) over a pluggable set of base learners plus a meta-learner (defaults to OLS).
- **Hierarchical Composition**: `hierarchical_composition::HierarchicalComposition` trains every level for real; its `Stacked` strategy builds meta-features via genuine out-of-fold cross-validation instead of a placeholder.
- **Model Fusion**: `model_fusion::ModelFusion` trains its base models via real `fit()` calls; the `WeightedLinear` strategy solves a real OLS/ridge-regularized least-squares problem for fusion weights, and `NeuralNetwork` fusion trains a small MLP via real gradient descent. Other fusion strategies honestly return `NotImplemented` rather than fabricating a result.
- **Pipeline Visualization (not yet functional)**: `pipeline_visualization` types are wired into the public API, but rendering and graph/node/edge extraction now honestly return `NotImplemented` errors instead of fake or empty output — there is no working visualization output yet (see `TODO.md`).

## Quick Start

```rust
use sklears_compose::Pipeline;
// `scaler` and `model` must implement this crate's `PipelineStep` /
// `PipelinePredictor` trait objects (boxed) — see `src/pipeline.rs`.

let pipeline = Pipeline::builder()
    .step("scaler", Box::new(scaler))
    .estimator(Box::new(model))
    .build();

let fitted = pipeline.fit(&x_train.view(), &Some(&y_train.view()))?;
let predictions = fitted.predict(&x_test.view())?;
```

## Status

- Verified through workspace integration tests; `0.2.0` records 782 passing tests (`cargo nextest run -p sklears-compose --all-features`, re-verified 2026-07-11).
- Supports all major scikit-learn compose APIs plus Rust-centric ergonomic improvements.
- This session replaced several silently-faked training paths with real implementations: ensemble `model_fusion` (real fit calls, real OLS/ridge weight solve, real gradient-descent neural fusion), `hierarchical_composition` (every level genuinely trained, real out-of-fold stacking), and a new `stacking` module. `pipeline_visualization` now honestly reports `NotImplemented` instead of returning fake output, but rendering itself is still not implemented.
- Future enhancements (async pipelines, streaming feature unions, full pipeline visualization) tracked in `TODO.md`.
