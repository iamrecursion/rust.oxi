## [Unreleased] — Japanese, and answers made only of evidence

Two separate defects, found by running the four layers on a Japanese corpus and reading what came
out rather than reading the code.

### Fixed

- **Layers 3 and 4 returned nothing at all on Japanese.** Measured on a seven-document Japanese
  corpus: `entities: 0`, `relationships: 0`, `claims: 0`, `summary: "No verifiable claims found"`.
  Layer 1 ranked correctly throughout — it works on character bigrams and never needed words. The
  cause was two assumptions baked into every heuristic in Layers 2–4: that sentences end in `.`,
  `!` or `?`, and that words are separated by whitespace. Japanese does neither, so a paragraph
  arrived at the claim extractor as one "sentence" holding one 40-character "word", and the
  extractor bailed at its two-token minimum. The entity extractor, meanwhile, looked for capital
  letters in a script that has no case.

  New `crate::text` carries the script-aware primitives: sentence splitting that knows `。！？` and
  treats a newline as a boundary, particle- and script-boundary segmentation, topic/copula/negation
  handling, and Han/Katakana noun-phrase candidates. `AdvancedClaimExtractor` gained a Japanese
  predicate path (`A は B です` → `Predicate`, `A は B を C ません` → `Not(Predicate)`);
  `PatternEntityExtractor` gained Japanese noun candidates and suffix classification (`県`/`市`/`山`
  → `Location`, `大学`/`会社` → `Organization`); `PatternRelationshipExtractor` gained Japanese
  patterns and, because Japanese is verb-final, now also searches the span AFTER the second entity —
  `OxiRAG は OxiZ を使います` puts the verb where a between-the-entities search cannot see it.
  English extraction is unchanged: `crate::text::tokenize` keeps the historical whitespace path for
  text with no CJK in it. Covered by `tests/japanese_pipeline.rs`.

- **`RuleBasedSpeculator::revise_draft` put commentary and mid-word fragments into the answer.** It
  built `"Based on the available information: " + the first 100 CHARACTERS of each of three
  documents + the draft + "[Revision notes: …]"`. Layer 3 verifies the revised draft and prints one
  row per claim, so every piece of that was visible to a reader as a verdict:
  `MeCrab uses the IPADIC dicti OxiZ is a Pure Rust SMT solver` was one row — two unrelated halves
  of two documents, cut mid-word by a character count, marked `Verified`. The context is where the
  draft came from, so re-prepending it also duplicated every sentence: the same claim appeared two
  and three times. Revision now adds whole retrieved SENTENCES that cover query terms the draft is
  missing, de-duplicated, and adds nothing else. The issues are still reported on
  `SpeculationResult::issues`, which is where a caller reads them; they no longer travel inside the
  answer.

### Changed

- **`RagPipeline::generate_draft` is sentence-level.** It concatenated the top three documents
  whole, so a question about penguins produced an answer that also explained bicycles, because the
  bicycle document ranked third — and every downstream layer then graded and verified that padding.
  It now scores each sentence of the top three documents against the query and keeps the ones that
  share terms with it, best first, capped at five. A draft is still never empty: with nothing above
  the bar, the top document's opening sentences are used and Layer 2 is left to mark the answer as
  weak.
- `AdvancedClaimExtractor::extract_claims` de-duplicates by normalised sentence.

## [Unreleased] — `wasm32-unknown-unknown`

OxiRAG advertised WASM support it did not have. `categories` listed `"wasm"`, the crate shipped
`src/wasm.rs`, `src/wasm_worker.rs`, two IndexedDB backends and an npm package — and
`cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --no-default-features --features wasm` reported
**34 errors** (39 with `echo`). This release makes the target real, and adds the gates that keep it
that way. See [ADR-0006](docs/adr/0006-wasm-portability-substrate.md).

### Fixed

- **`async_trait`'s `Send` bound, 122 further sites.** ADR-0005 established the
  `cfg_attr(target_arch = "wasm32", async_trait(?Send))` pair for six traits in 0.5.0; every
  `#[async_trait]` written after it had not received it. The relaxation is viral, so the symptom
  surfaced as "future is not `Send`" at callers (`reranker.rs`, `pipeline.rs`) rather than at the
  impls at fault. All sites now carry the pair.
- **Runtime traps: `Instant::now()` and `SystemTime::now()`.** Both **panic** on
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, and `Pipeline::process` called the first on every query — under a
  `panic = "abort"` release profile, an uncatchable trap that kills the page hosting the engine.
  All 56 + 9 call sites now go through the new `crate::time`. Verified in a real wasm runtime by
  `tests/wasm_clock.rs`. `chrono`'s `Utc::now()` was NOT affected (the `wasmbind` feature routes it
  through `Date.now()`) and is unchanged.
- **`web_sys::window()` in a Web Worker.** A RAG pipeline blocks its thread, so its correct host is a
  worker, where `window()` is `None`. Two sites wrote `.expect("no window")` (a trap on the retry
  path); two returned `"IndexedDB not available in this browser"`, which is false — IndexedDB is
  available to workers through `WorkerGlobalScope`. All four now go through the new
  `crate::global_scope`.
- **IndexedDB backends had rotted against `web-sys` 0.3.104.** `IdbRequest::result()` returns
  `Result<JsValue, JsValue>` now, not `Result<Option<JsValue>, _>`; the `IdbTransactionMode` feature
  was never enabled; `IndexedDbVectorStore` was never re-exported from `layer1_echo`.
- **`tokio::sync::RwLock` in twelve runtime-free modules** — BM25, the circuit breaker, the in-memory
  vector store, collections, conversation, document-pipeline, distillation hot-swap, index
  management. Now `crate::sync`.
- **`HiddenStateCache` forked to `Arc<RefCell<…>>`** under `cfg(not(feature = "native"))`, which made
  `Speculator` (`: Send + Sync`) unimplementable on `wasm32`. The fork bought nothing —
  `std::sync::RwLock` works there — and is deleted. `Speculator`'s supertrait is unchanged.

### Added

- **`crate::time`** — `Instant` and `system_now()`, backed by `js_sys::Date::now()` on `wasm32` and
  `std::time` elsewhere. Every subtraction saturates rather than panicking.
- **`crate::sync`** — `RwLock` / `Mutex` from `tokio::sync` with the `native` feature and from
  `async-lock` otherwise, plus `try_read` (the two backends disagree on `Result` vs `Option`) and
  `MaybeSendSync`.
- **`crate::global_scope`** — `Window`-or-`WorkerGlobalScope`, exposing `indexed_db()` and
  `set_timeout()`.
- **`clippy.toml`** — `disallowed-methods` for `Instant::now`, `SystemTime::now` and
  `web_sys::window`, each naming its replacement. This is the load-bearing half of ADR-0006: the
  previous decision decayed because it depended on everyone remembering it.
- **`Pipeline::config_mut()`** — lets a caller turn the fast path on and off between queries without
  rebuilding the pipeline, and with it the index its layers hold.
- **`tests/wasm_clock.rs`** — five tests that execute under `wasm-pack test --node`. Making that
  possible required moving native-only dev-dependencies (`proptest` → `rusty-fork` → `wait-timeout`,
  which does not compile for wasm32) under a target table, gating 298 `#[cfg(test)]` modules to
  non-wasm, and naming `native` in every example/bench `required-features`. `tests/wasm_indexeddb.rs`
  and `tests/wasm_worker.rs` had existed since 0.5.0 and had never executed.

### Changed

- **BREAKING.** `Instant` in public struct fields (`prefix_cache::paging::CachePage`,
  `prefix_cache::types`, `semantic_cache::entry`, `hidden_states::cache`) is now
  `oxirag::time::Instant` rather than `std::time::Instant`. `From`/`Into` and `into_std()` convert.
- **The `wasm` feature now means only "expose the `#[wasm_bindgen]` API".** The crates it used to
  name are unconditional `[target.'cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")'.dependencies]`, because a wasm32
  build without them is not a smaller build but a broken one. A downstream shim with its own
  `#[wasm_bindgen]` boundary can now take OxiRAG *without* the feature and not inherit a second
  `#[wasm_bindgen(start)]`. `pub mod wasm` is additionally gated to `target_arch = "wasm32"`.
- `async-lock` is an unconditional dependency on every target, so that "OxiRAG without tokio" is a
  configuration that compiles everywhere rather than one that compiles on wasm32 and nowhere else.
- `prefix_cache::persistent` is gated to `feature = "native"` (it is filesystem-backed, and
  `OxiRagError::Io` only wraps `std::io::Error` there).

### Known limitation

- **`WasmRagEngine` in `src/wasm.rs` is built on `MockEmbeddingProvider`, which cannot retrieve.**
  That provider hashes the *whole text* into one `u64`, so cosine similarity between any two
  distinct strings is noise: measured at 384 dimensions, `"the cat sat on the mat"` vs
  `"the cat sat on a mat"` scores **0.0284** while `"the cat sat on a mat"` vs
  `"quantum chromodynamics"` scores **0.0762** — the near-duplicate pair scores *lower* than an
  unrelated one. It is documented as deterministic-for-testing and is fine for that; it is not a
  retrieval provider, and the crate's own advertised WASM API should not be built on it. Callers
  needing real retrieval must supply their own `EmbeddingProvider` (the trait is public and
  `EchoLayer::new` accepts any implementation). Not fixed here because choosing a replacement is an
  API decision, not a port.
## [0.24.0] - 2026-07-12

Twelve cutting-edge RAG modules across four themes — Inference-Time Control, Test-Time Search & Process
Supervision, Serving Runtime, and Corpus Governance & Fairness — all pure-Rust implementations with
zero new dependencies. +406 tests (11,545 → 11,951), 209 module directories. Pre-validated by four
parallel read-only recon passes that killed two candidates before any code was written (`speculative_rag`
already exists as `speculative_drafting`; `multi_lora_serving` inherits candle or a self-referential
oracle) and rescoped a third (`corpus_curation` composes the existing `lsh` MinHash rather than adding a
fourth). Zero prelude aliases required.

### Added

- **`constrained_decoding`** (`constrained-decoding`): Decode-time constrained generation — a regex
  dialect and a JSON-Schema compiler lowered through an AST to a Thompson NFA and then a
  subset-construction DFA, a per-DFA-state vocabulary FSM index with co-accessibility (liveness)
  pruning, and a byte-level logit mask that forbids any token which would leave the automaton unable to
  complete a valid string. `ConstrainedDecoder`, `Dfa`, `Nfa`, `RegexAst`, `ConstrainedVocabulary`,
  `compile_json_schema`, `parse_regex`. Measured: a Thompson-NFA set-simulation and the compiled DFA
  agree on all ~1.75M strings up to length 8 over a 4-symbol alphabet (0 disagreements); `serde_json`
  as an independent oracle caught a grammar that admitted `"-0"`. Greenfield — the crate had no regex
  dependency and no automaton. Distinct from `watermarking`, whose `-inf` mask is a keyed hash covering
  a fixed `gamma·|V|` fraction and constrains provenance, not syntax; and from `structured_extraction`
  / `output_validation`, which reject an invalid string after it exists rather than making it
  unreachable. 65 tests.
- **`context_aware_decoding`** (`context-aware-decoding`): Decode-time distribution contrast — Context-
  Aware Decoding (`(1+a)·logit(y|c,x) − a·logit(y|x)`), Contrastive Decoding with the adaptive
  plausibility constraint, and DoLa with JSD-selected premature-layer contrast (the crate's only
  Jensen-Shannon divergence). `ContextAwareDecoder`, `ContrastiveDecoder`, `DoLaDecoder`,
  `cad_jensen_shannon_divergence`, `LayeredLanguageModel`. Measured: the CAD adjustment is bit-for-bit
  equal to `replug::math::log_linear_pool_log_probs(&[1+a, −a], ..)` where no truncation fires, then on
  a crafted input the unconstrained kernel amplifies a 4e−6 token to p=0.99998 while the constrained
  decoder correctly masks it. Distinct from `replug`, which interpolates distributions with non-negative
  weights (a convex mixture that never subtracts one); this module extrapolates with a negative
  coefficient and therefore needs the plausibility constraint a mixture never does. 38 tests.
- **`activation_steering`** (`activation-steering`): Inference-Time Intervention and Contrastive
  Activation Addition — per-head linear probes (logistic regression by gradient descent with a derived
  safe step size, plus the closed-form mass-mean direction), top-K head selection by validation
  accuracy, and an `alpha·sigma` residual-stream shift applied through a real mid-forward hook.
  `ActivationSteering`, `LinearProbe`, `SteeringVector`, `SteerableModel`, `Intervention`. Measured:
  the mass-mean probe recovers a planted unit direction at cosine 0.9994, top-K selects exactly the 3
  of 8 signal heads, and the steering shift matches the predicted `alpha·sigma` to four digits. States
  two honest limits and proves them by test: the crate's captured `ModelHiddenStates` has no
  mid-forward hook, and per-head activations are not stored (`attention_weights` holds probabilities,
  not head outputs). Distinct from `hidden_states`, which captures activations but never modifies them,
  and `eigenscore`, which reads response embeddings, not internal activations. 24 tests.
- **`process_reward_model`** (`process-reward-model`): Step-level (process) reward — Math-Shepherd
  Monte-Carlo rollout auto-labelling (a step's soft label is the fraction of continuations that reach
  the correct answer), min/product/last step-score aggregation, and best-of-N reranking against an
  outcome-only baseline. `ProcessRewardModel`, `OutcomeRewardModel`, `BestOfN`, `StepAggregation`,
  `MonteCarloProcessReward`. Measured: the estimated soft label recovers a known true p=0.70 to 0.696
  at R=500 (inside the Hoeffding bound); on two trajectories that reach the same answer, the PRM's
  min-aggregation localizes a flaw to exactly step 1 (score 0.106) where the outcome model ties both at
  1.0. Distinct from `llm_judge`, `trust_score`, and `chainpoll`, which score a finished answer as one
  unit. 11 tests.
- **`mcts_reasoning`** (`mcts-reasoning`): Monte-Carlo Tree Search over reasoning steps — UCT and
  AlphaZero-PUCT selection, rollout simulation, value backpropagation, and progressive widening, with
  max-visit final selection and a deterministic tie-break. `MctsEngine`, `MctsNode`,
  `MctsSelectionPolicy`, `MctsStepGenerator`, `MctsTerminalEvaluator`. Measured: exact UCT scores
  asserted bit-for-bit on a 3-child/6-visit fixture; the regret ratio regret(2000)/regret(500) = 1.22
  (≈log growth) versus >3.5 for random descent; and `N(s)=1+ΣN(child)`, `Q=W/N` hold exactly on every
  internal node. Distinct from `tree_of_thought`, whose BFS/beam and DFS write each node's value once at
  expansion and never revise it; nothing else in the crate does rollout or value backpropagation.
  46 tests.
- **`self_taught_reasoner`** (`self-taught-reasoner`): STaR bootstrapping — keep rationales whose answer
  is correct, rationalize backwards from the gold answer for those that fail, accumulate a bootstrapped
  set, and iterate to a fixed point, with a structural task-agnostic cheat-rationale detector.
  `SelfTaughtReasoner`, `ReasoningModel`, `RationaleSet`, `is_cheating_rationale`, `RationalizationStyle`.
  Measured: on a learnable modular-arithmetic task, forward accuracy climbs `[1/13, 5/13, 9/13, 1.0,
  1.0]` to a converged ceiling; the rationalization ablation lifts coverage from 0.5 to 1.0 with the gap
  set equal to exactly the 13 problems the forward pass cannot solve. Distinct from `self_consistency`,
  which samples K rationales and marginalizes them away rather than keeping the ones that worked.
  30 tests.
- **`continuous_batching`** (`continuous-batching`): PagedAttention-style KV block management — a
  fixed-size block allocator with copy-on-write sharing, growing per-sequence block tables, preemption
  by recompute or swap, and iteration-level (per-decode-step) scheduling, built as a block-structured
  view over the existing contiguous KV tensor. `KvBlockAllocator`, `KvBlockTable`,
  `ContinuousBatchEngine`, `BatchSequence`, `BatchPreemptionMode`. Measured: attention gathered through
  a fragmented, non-monotone block table equals `kv_cache_compression::scaled_dot_product_attention`
  over the equivalent contiguous tensor bit-for-bit; N sequences sharing a P-token prefix occupy
  `blocks(P) + N·blocks(suffix)` blocks (sharing factor 2.4, exact); allocator conservation holds after
  6,000 seeded churn operations. Distinct from `prefix_cache::paging`, which allocates fresh immutable
  pages per fingerprint and never shares a page, and from `memory_paging`, which pages conversational
  text. 25 tests.
- **`request_scheduling`** (`request-scheduling`): The SLO-aware policy layer above a serving backend —
  TTFT/TPOT admission control, priority classes, Deficit-Round-Robin and Weighted-Fair-Queueing fair
  scheduling, Earliest-Deadline-First ordering, and starvation bounds over logical ticks, behind its own
  `SchedulerExecutor` trait. `RequestScheduler`, `SchedulingPolicy`, `SchedulerExecutor`, `SloTarget`,
  `AdmissionController`. Measured: EDF's maximum lateness equals the brute-force optimum over all n!
  permutations (Jackson's rule) across 48 seeded instances; DRR service is exactly `m·Q − deficit` with
  deficits bounded by the max packet; the starvation ablation shows a naive priority victim's wait grows
  51→91 under load while DRR's stays flood-independent at 19. Distinct from `connection_pool`, an unfair
  semaphore over idle connections that knows nothing of priority, deadline, or remaining work. 15 tests.
- **`chunked_prefill`** (`chunked-prefill`): Sarathi-Serve stall-free batching — a long prompt's prefill
  split into token-budgeted chunks packed one-per-iteration with as many decodes as fit, with piecewise
  causal masking and absolute-position bookkeeping across chunk boundaries. `ChunkedPrefill`,
  `PrefillScheduler`, `PrefillChunk`, `TokenBudget`, `PrefillModel`. Measured: for every one of the 512
  compositions of a 10-token prompt, the chunked KV tensor and every attention output are bit-for-bit
  identical to a one-shot prefill computed from the existing attention kernel (a deliberately injected
  boundary off-by-one is proven to break the invariant); the stall-free bound `max-gap ≤ B` is tight.
  Distinct from `continuous_batching` (where the bytes live) and `request_scheduling` (across-request
  ordering); this module owns within-request work splitting. 23 tests.
- **`corpus_curation`** (`corpus-curation`, depends on `lsh`): Ingest-time corpus quality — Gopher/C4
  heuristic quality signals, a trained binary logistic quality classifier over hashed text features, and
  eval-set contamination detection (verbatim and n-gram-overlap against a held-out benchmark, with a
  corpus-level contamination rate and a decontamination action). `CorpusCurator`, `QualityClassifier`,
  `ContaminationDetector`, `QualityRule`, `find_near_duplicate_clusters`. Measured: the classifier
  reaches 0.9056 held-out accuracy versus a 0.5167 majority baseline; contamination detection finds 6/6
  planted items with 0 false positives at a rate of exactly 0.3; end-to-end curation lifts precision@10
  from 0.70 to 1.00. Composes the existing `lsh_index::MinHashIndex` for near-duplicate clustering
  rather than adding a fourth MinHash. Distinct from `semantic_dedup` and `lsh_index`, which filter a
  retrieved result set or serve k-NN queries; this filters the corpus at ingest. 39 tests.
- **`fairness_ranking`** (`fairness-ranking`): Group-exposure fairness in ranked lists — FA*IR ranked
  group fairness on an exact binomial CDF (hand-rolled Lanczos log-gamma and u128 coefficients) with a
  recursive multiple-test correction, DELTR disparate-exposure regularization, and Biega amortized
  equity-of-attention via a from-scratch Hungarian assignment solver. `FairnessRanker`, `binomial_cdf`,
  `solve_assignment`, `DeltrModel`, `ExposureMetrics`. Measured: the exact binomial CDF matches rational
  arithmetic to <1e-12 and is asserted to diverge from the normal approximation (Bin(5,0.1): exact
  0.59049 vs normal 0.5), proving it did not silently substitute the crate's `normal_cdf`; the
  assignment solver matches brute force over all n! permutations; FA*IR cuts exposure disparity 0.0999→
  0.0282 at an nDCG cost of 0.004. Distinct from `diversity_rank` and `retrieval_diversity`, which
  maximize content dissimilarity or subtopic coverage and have no notion of a protected group. 49 tests.
- **`knowledge_editing`** (`knowledge-editing`): Locate-then-edit plus deferral memory — a ROME closed-
  form rank-1 update to a linear memory matrix with exact post-conditions (`W'k*=v*`; `W'kᵢ≈Wkᵢ` for
  preserved keys), a MEMIT-style multi-edit path with measured drift, and a persistent non-evicting
  GRACE/SERAC deferral codebook consulted within a radius at inference. `KnowledgeEditor`, `RankOneEdit`,
  `EditCodebook`, `EditableMemory`, `MultiEdit`. Measured: `W'k*=v*` to <1e-9; the closed form agrees
  with an independent projected-gradient solve to <1e-6; the codebook serves 50/50 edits under pressure
  where an LRU drops to 8/50; overdetermined (E>d) edits are honestly rejected with rollback rather than
  silently regularized. Uses its own hand-rolled `linalg` (with `KnowledgeEditLinalgError`, not the
  preluded `LinalgError`) to keep the feature independent. Distinct from `knowledge_unlearning`, which
  deletes documents, and `belief_revision`, which updates a posterior over a fixed hypothesis set.
  28 tests.

### Changed

- **`speculative_drafting`**: closed two deviations from Wang et al. 2024, both additive (defaults
  preserve existing behavior bit-for-bit; all 66 prior tests unchanged and passing). Added an opt-in
  `DraftSubsetStrategy::OneRepresentativePerCluster` that samples one document from each cluster per
  subset (the paper's scheme) alongside the existing per-cluster default, and an optional draft
  `rationale` with a self-reflection term so the verifier score becomes `ρ_SC × ρ_SR` when a rationale
  is present. +13 tests (66 → 79).

### Theme umbrellas

- `inference-time-control` = `constrained-decoding` + `context-aware-decoding` + `activation-steering`
- `test-time-search` = `process-reward-model` + `mcts-reasoning` + `self-taught-reasoner`
- `serving-runtime` = `continuous-batching` + `request-scheduling` + `chunked-prefill`
- `corpus-governance` = `corpus-curation` + `fairness-ranking` + `knowledge-editing`

### Verification

`cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings` (0 warnings),
`cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features` (11,951 passed, 8 network-guarded skips), and
`RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --all-features --no-deps` all green. Every new module carries a
measurement-based headline test that falsifies against independent ground truth (brute-force optima,
the existing attention kernel, exact rational arithmetic, known generating processes, or naive-baseline
ablations); each caught a real bug during development. Zero prelude aliases; the toolchain (rustc
1.97.0) matched the previous release, so no drift-cleanup pass was needed.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-07-11

Twelve cutting-edge RAG modules across four themes — Constrained & Mutable Search, Probabilistic IR &
Counterfactual Learning, Ensemble & Collaborative Generation, and Privacy, Provenance & Context
Governance — all pure-Rust implementations with zero new dependencies. +587 tests (10,958 → 11,545),
197 module directories.

### Added

- **`filtered_vector_search`** (`filtered-vector-search`): ACORN/Filtered-DiskANN predicate-constrained
  ANN — a self-contained Vamana graph with predicate-aware traversal that routes THROUGH non-matching
  nodes (two-hop expansion) plus a selectivity estimator (histograms + value counts) that picks
  pre-/post-/in-filter. `FilteredVectorIndex`, `FilterPredicate`, `AttrValue`, `FilterStrategy`.
  Measured: at 1% selectivity, naive post-filter recall@10 collapses to 0.090 (its s·m ceiling) while
  in-filter reaches 0.960 and pre-filter 1.000. Distinct from the crate's only prior filtered search (a
  fixed-10× over-fetch post-filter on a legacy HNSW clone). 68 tests.
- **`dynamic_pruning`** (`dynamic-pruning`): WAND / BlockMax-WAND / MaxScore top-k early termination
  over a real term→sorted-posting-list BM25 inverted index with block-max metadata. Returns top-k
  BIT-IDENTICAL to exhaustive scoring while skipping postings (measured BlockMaxWand 409 vs Wand 528 vs
  Exhaustive 5,543 postings, 13.5× fewer). `DynamicPruningIndex`, `PruningStrategy`, `PruningStats`.
  Distinct from `sparse_retrieval`/`bm25f_retrieval` (exhaustive forward scans, no posting lists).
  44 tests.
- **`index_maintenance`** (`index-maintenance`): FreshDiskANN-style mutable proximity-graph ANN —
  tombstone deletion (traversed through, excluded from results), in-place insert with backward-edge
  repair, and a bridging+Vamana-refinement consolidation pass. Measured: under 30% delete + 30% insert
  churn, naive hard-delete degrades to recall@10 0.875 with 49 orphans, while tombstone+consolidate
  holds 0.963 with 0 orphans. `MaintainableIndex`, `ConsolidationReport`. Distinct from the 17
  build-once/append-only ANN modules. 19 tests.
- **`language_model_retrieval`** (`language-model-retrieval`): Query-likelihood LM retrieval with
  Dirichlet, Jelinek-Mercer, and absolute-discounting smoothing, the DFR family (PL2, DPH), and RM3
  relevance-model feedback built on the LM (log-sum-exp-stable query posteriors). Hand-computed scores
  verified to 1e-12. `LmRetrievalIndex`, `LmSmoothing`, `DfrModel`, `Rm3Config`. Distinct from
  BM25/BM25F/SPLADE/COIL (the crate's only prior scorers) and from `relevance_feedback`'s Rocchio /
  `query_expansion`'s TF-PRF (neither is a probabilistic LM). 42 tests.
- **`click_model`** (`click-model`): Position-Based, Cascade, and Dynamic-Bayesian-Network click models
  fit by EM (log-likelihood proven monotone), whose examination probabilities become propensities
  driving IPS / SNIPS / doubly-robust debiased ranking. Measured: raw CTR ranks a position-biased
  mediocre doc above an excellent one; the IPS-debiased ranker recovers the true order.
  `PositionBasedModel`, `CascadeClickModel`, `DbnClickModel`, `CounterfactualEstimator`. Distinct from
  supervised `learning_to_rank` (explicit labels, no bias handling). 65 tests.
- **`bandit_ranker`** (`bandit-ranker`): Online rank exploration via LinUCB (Sherman-Morrison rank-1
  inverse updates, matched to a direct inverse within 8.97e-19), Thompson sampling (Cholesky
  posterior), and ε-greedy, with cumulative-regret tracking (measured sublinear) and replay-based
  off-policy evaluation. Deterministic seeded SplitMix64 — no `rand`. `LinUcbRanker`,
  `ThompsonSamplingRanker`, `BanditRegretTracker`. Distinct from `ab_eval` (offline paired test) and
  `active_learning_retrieval` (offline uncertainty sampling). 80 tests.
- **`replug`** (`replug`): REPLUG output-distribution ensembling — `p(y|q) = Σ_i λ(d_i|q)·p(y|d_i⊕q)`
  with `λ=softmax(sim/τ)`, a mixture of DISTRIBUTIONS (not logits; the geometric-pool difference is a
  regression test), plus REPLUG-LSR retriever feedback via KL. Defines its own token-distribution trait
  (no crate API exposed one). `ReplugEngine`, `ReplugLanguageModel`, `ReplugLsrSignal`. Distinct from
  `ensemble_retriever`/`rank_fusion`/`answer_aggregator`/`fusion_in_decoder` (which combine
  retrievers/lists/strings, never distributions). 53 tests.
- **`mixture_of_agents`** (`mixture-of-agents`): Layered Mixture-of-Agents — N proposers per layer, an
  aggregator that SYNTHESIZES (coverage-preserving merge, not selection), and the synthesis seeds the
  next layer's proposers. `MoaEngine`, `MoaSynthesisAggregator`, `MoaTrace`. Distinct from
  `multi_agent_debate` (adversarial, fixed positions, judge picks a winner) and `self_consistency` (no
  inter-agent communication, vote-only). 75 tests.
- **`chain_of_agents`** (`chain-of-agents`): Chain-of-Agents long-context reading — sequential worker
  agents over input chunks, each passing an evolving bounded communication unit forward, then a
  manager that reads only the final unit. Ablation proves the unit is load-bearing (zeroing it fails a
  first-chunk↔last-chunk question the full chain answers). `CoaEngine`, `CoaCommunicationUnit`,
  `CoaManager`. Distinct from `skeleton_of_thought` (parallel) and `graph_summarization` (map-reduce).
  36 tests.
- **`kv_cache_compression`** (`kv-cache-compression`): Attention-score-driven KV-cache token eviction —
  H2O heavy-hitter (accumulated attention mass), StreamingLLM attention sinks, and SnapKV
  observation-window voting, over a real scaled-dot-product-attention KV tensor. Measured: at a 25%
  budget, H2O/SnapKV deviate 0.0048 from full attention vs naive RecencyLRU's 1.0066 (~210×); deleting
  StreamingLLM sink tokens vs middle tokens gives a ~25,000× output-deviation asymmetry.
  `KvCacheCompressor`, `KvEvictionPolicy`, `KvCacheTensor`. Distinct from `prefix_cache` (prompt-blob
  LRU) and `hidden_states` (whole-entry LRU). 31 tests.

  (deterministic) green/red vocab partition, soft (δ-bias) and hard variants, z-score detection
  `z=(|s|_G−γT)/√(Tγ(1−γ))` with a self-implemented normal CDF. Measured: true-positive z=34.6, and the
  false-positive rate is calibrated to the normal tail (empirical 0.0537 vs theoretical 0.05 at
  z≥1.645). `WatermarkGenerator`, `WatermarkDetector`, `WatermarkMode`. Distinct from
  `attribution`/`quote_grounding`/`citation_verification` (retrieved-source attribution, not
  generation-time provenance). 47 tests.
- **`knowledge_unlearning`** (`knowledge-unlearning`): GDPR/right-to-be-forgotten unlearning —
  deletion-request scope resolution (near-duplicate MinHash detection + derived-artifact cascade),
  deletion, and a post-deletion leakage re-audit that escalates until clean or honestly reports
  non-convergence. Measured: delete-by-id alone leaves a paraphrase leaking at score 0.569; the full
  engine catches the carrier and re-audits clean, leaving unrelated docs untouched. `UnlearningEngine`,
  `UnlearnableStore`, `UnlearningCertificate`. Distinct from `membership_inference` (audit+redact only)
  and `collections`/`layer1_echo` deletion (no leakage verification). 27 tests.

### Theme umbrellas

Also fixed: `layer2_speculator::candle_slm` per-token log-probabilities were the max raw logit
(unnormalized) rather than the sampled token's log-softmax value — now correct. Toolchain-drift
cleanup: fixed new-lint clippy errors (`manual_assert_eq`, `question_mark`,
`useless_borrows_in_formatting`) and 61 rustdoc intra-doc-link warnings across 26 files; added
`required-features` for the `candle_slm_example`/`lora_training_example`/`otel_tracing` examples and
the `trait_bounds_native` test. `cargo fmt` + `build`/`clippy`/`nextest`/`doc` all `--all-features
--all-targets -D warnings` → 0 errors, 0 warnings, 11,545 tests passing.

  carries forward to later principles. `ConstitutionalEngine`, `ConstitutionalPrinciple`. Distinct from

  iterative revise loop). 86 tests.
- **`tool_retrieval`** (`tool-retrieval`): Semantic tool/API-spec retrieval + argument grounding — a
  registry of `ToolSpecEntry` (name/description/JSON-schema-like params) matched by description
  embedding + lexical overlap (not name substring), with type-aware argument extraction
  (String/Number/Boolean/Enum) that explicitly flags ungrounded required parameters. `ToolRetrievalEngine`,
  `ArgumentGrounder`. Adds the semantic-retrieval + arg-grounding layer `agentic`'s `Tool`/`ToolRegistry`
  lacks, without redefining it. 71 tests.
- **`code_retrieval`** (`code-retrieval`): AST/structure-aware code search — a lightweight brace/
  keyword/indentation structural tokenizer (function defs, imports, identifiers, call sites) blended
  with text similarity; structural signal demonstrably changes ranking vs pure text (adversarial test:
  shared-vocabulary-only vs shared-identifiers-only candidates swap rank as blend weight moves).
  `CodeRetrievalEngine`, `CodeRetrievalUnit`. Distinct from `program_of_thought`'s AST-for-execution
  (tiny arithmetic DSL, not a code search corpus). 72 tests.
- **`extractive_qa`** (`extractive-qa`): SQuAD-style extractive span answering — question-type-aware

  candidate spans, blended with surrounding-context overlap and a length prior. `ExtractiveQaEngine`,
  `AnswerSpan`. Distinct from `quote_grounding`'s claim→supporting-quote substantiation framing

  `self_ask`/`long_rag`'s generation. 88 tests.
- **`hard_negative_mining`** (`hard-negative-mining`): ANCE-style asynchronous hard-negative mining —
  periodic corpus re-ranking under a version-parameterized embedding function, mining top-ranked-

  measuring how much the mined set drifts as the embedding version changes. `HardNegativeMiner`,

  `distillation`'s negative-free Q&A collection. 51 tests.
- **`active_learning_retrieval`** (`active-learning-retrieval`): Uncertainty-sampling pool selection —
  margin sampling and Shannon-entropy sampling (both verified against hand-computed ground truth, e.g.
  uniform-3-way entropy = ln 3) rank a pool of unlabeled items by informativeness, with an optional
  greedy diversity filter. `ActiveLearningSelector`, `UncertaintyMeasure`. Distinct from `skr`'s
  per-query retrieve gate and `dragin`'s token-level trigger (neither ranks a pool). 60 tests.
- **`belief_revision`** (`belief-revision`): Bayesian belief updating over retrieved evidence — an
  explicit posterior over candidate hypotheses updated via genuine log-odds likelihood-ratio Bayes
  updates (numerically stable `logsumexp`), proven correct against hand-computed two-hypothesis Bayes
  rule and stable under 150+ sequential updates where naive linear-space underflows to zero.
  `BeliefState`, `BeliefRevisionEngine`. Distinct from `knowledge_conflict`'s fixed-policy pairwise
  resolution and `conformal_rag`'s static coverage-guaranteed set (neither is an evolving posterior).
  70 tests.

  shards by predicted relevance from lightweight resource-description statistics (term/document
  frequency digests) **before** querying any of them; the classical distributed-IR resource-selection
  problem. `ShardSelector`, `ShardDescriptor`. Explicitly out of scope: post-query score
  calibration/merging, already covered by `ensemble_retriever`/`rank_fusion`/`collections`. 63 tests.

- **`erag`** (`erag`): eRAG retriever evaluation via per-document downstream utility (Salemi & Zamani
  2024) — runs the downstream task on each retrieved document individually, aggregates utility, and
  correlates (Kendall's τ, Spearman's ρ) with end-to-end quality across a case batch. `ERagEvaluator`,
  `kendall_tau`, `spearman_rho`. 79 tests.
- **`eigenscore`** (`eigenscore`): INSIDE/EigenScore hallucination detection (Chen et al. 2024) — a
  pure-Rust cyclic Jacobi eigensolver computes the differential entropy of the regularized covariance
  of K sampled-response embeddings. `EigenScoreDetector`, `symmetric_eigenvalues`. 110 tests.
- **Theme umbrellas**: `scalable-indexing`, `query-transformation`, `reasoning-compression`,
  `trust-eval`.

### Fixed

- **`advanced_retrieval::mmr`**: fixed a stale doctest passing an owned `Vec<SearchResult>` where
  `MmrReranker::rerank` expects `&[SearchResult]`.
- **`retrieval_loop::generator`**: fixed a doctest using `gen` as a local variable name, which became a
  reserved keyword under edition 2024.
- **`chunking::strategies`**: fixed three stale doctests (`SentenceChunker`, `RecursiveChunker`,
  `MarkdownChunker`) that omitted `.with_min_chunk_size(1)`, causing short example text to be filtered
  below the default `min_chunk_size` of 50 and produce zero chunks.

Next-Gen Retrieval Architectures, Adaptive Generation Strategies, Knowledge & Context Management,
and Evaluation & Benchmarking — all pure-Rust heuristic implementations with zero new dependencies.

### Added

#### Theme 1 — Next-Gen Retrieval Architectures

- **HippoRAG** (feature `hipporag`): Gutiérrez et al. 2024. Builds an entity graph (entities co-occurring in a passage are linked) and runs **Personalized PageRank** seeded from the query's entities to score passages by their entities' PPR mass — capturing multi-hop associations in a *single* retrieval step. `HippoRagIndex.build()/search()`. Distinct from `multi_hop` (BFS). 55 tests.
- **LongRAG** (feature `long-rag`): Jiang et al. 2024. Groups chunks/documents into a small number of *long* retrieval units (`ByDocument` / `BySemanticAdjacency` / `FixedTokenWindow`) up to a token budget, reducing fragmentation. `LongUnitGrouper.group()`, `LongRagRetriever.search()`. 53 tests.
- **DRAGIN** (feature `dragin`): Su et al. 2024. Dynamic retrieval driven by real-time information need — RIND triggers retrieval on high token uncertainty + content-ness; QFS formulates the query from salient tokens of the recent generated window. `DraginEngine.run` over `UncertaintyGenerator`/`Retriever` traits. 65 tests.

#### Theme 2 — Adaptive Generation Strategies

- **Astute RAG** (feature `astute-rag`): Wang et al. 2024. Reconciles internal (parametric) vs external (retrieved) knowledge under imperfect retrieval — extracts external statements with corroboration-based reliability, detects conflicts, resolves by reliability + `prefer_external`, synthesizes an attributed answer. `AstuteConsolidator.consolidate()/run()`. 70 tests.
- **Self-Route** (feature `self-route`): Li et al. 2024.

Distinct from `adaptive_rag` (complexity→depth). 65 tests.
- **Speculative Drafting** (feature `speculative-drafting`): Wang et al. 2024 Speculative RAG. Clusters retrieved docs (deterministic k-means-lite), drafts one answer per cluster in parallel (`std::thread::scope`), then scores each by verifier support + cross-draft self-consistency and picks the best. `SpeculativeDrafter.run`. 66 tests.

#### Theme 3 — Knowledge & Context Management

- **MemoRAG** (feature `memorag`): Qian et al. 2024. Forms a global corpus memory gist (salient sentences + key terms), generates retrieval *clues* (query ⊕ gist key terms), retrieves evidence per clue and fuses by max-per-doc. `MemoRagEngine.build_memory()/generate_clues()/retrieve()`. 60 tests.
- **Context Pruning** (feature `context-pruning`): LLMLingua-style token-level compression — scores each token by rarity × content-ness × query-overlap (entities optionally preserved), keeps the top tokens to a target ratio while preserving original order. `TokenPruner.prune()`. Distinct from sentence-extractive `context_compression`. 61 tests.
- **Knowledge Conflict** (feature `knowledge-conflict`): inter-passage contradiction detection (negation/numeric/temporal mismatch on a shared subject) and resolution by `Recency` / `Authority` / `Majority` policy. `ConflictDetector.detect()`, `ConflictResolver.resolve()`.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-14

Twelve more cutting-edge RAG technique modules across four themes — Retrieval & Indexing,
Ranking & Fusion, Structured Reasoning, and Verification & Robustness — all pure-Rust heuristic
implementations with zero new dependencies.

### Added

#### Theme 1 — Retrieval & Indexing

- **Sparse Retrieval** (feature `sparse-retrieval`): SPLADE-style learned sparse retrieval. `SparseEncoder.fit()` computes IDF + a token co-occurrence table; `encode()` produces a `SparseVector` of log-saturated `ln(1 + max(0, tf*idf))` weights, then expands the term set with discounted co-occurring terms (simulating SPLADE expansion). `SparseIndex.search()` ranks by sparse dot product. Distinct from BM25 (`hybrid_search`). 56 tests.
- **Self-Query** (feature `self-query`): self-querying retriever. `SelfQueryParser.parse()` turns a natural-language query into a structured `ParsedFilter` (FilterCondition with Eq/Ne/Gt/Lt/Gte/Lte/Contains) + a residual semantic query, against a configurable `FilterSchema`. Detects "after/before <year>", "by <author>", "above/below <N>", "tagged <X>". `SelfQueryRetriever` applies the filter to document metadata. 65 tests.
- **Summary Index** (feature `summary-index`): LlamaIndex `DocumentSummaryIndex`. `ExtractiveSummarizer` builds a top-N TF-centrality summary per document; `SummaryIndex.search()` matches the query against summary embeddings but returns the FULL parent document. Flat (one summary per doc), distinct from RAPTOR's recursive tree. 58 tests.

#### Theme 2 — Ranking & Fusion

- **Rank Fusion** (feature `rank-fusion`): multi-list fusion beyond RRF. `RankFusion.fuse()` supports `CombSum`, `CombMnz` (rewards multi-list agreement), `CombAnz`, `Borda`, `Isr`, `WeightedSum`, and `Rrf`, with `ScoreNormalization` (MinMax/ZScore/SumTo1/None). Dedupes by `DocumentId`, deterministic tie-breaking. 55 tests.
- **Diversity Rank** (feature `diversity-rank`): Determinantal-Point-Process-inspired diverse selection. `DiversityRanker.select()` greedily maximizes a volume-style gain `quality² · Π(1 − sim)` over the selected set — distinct from MMR's linear λ trade-off — with a quality-fill fallback when no positive-gain candidate remains. 60 tests.
- **Source Credibility** (feature `source-credibility`): source authority scoring (distinct from answer-level `trust_score`). `SourceGraph.pagerank()` runs iterative PageRank over a citation graph (dangling-mass redistribution); `CredibilityScorer.score()` blends PageRank + exponential recency decay + metadata authority (trusted sources, author reputation); `rerank()` blends relevance with credibility. 75 tests.

#### Theme 3 — Structured Reasoning

- **Graph-of-Thoughts** (feature `graph-of-thought`): Besta et al. 2023. Generalizes ToT to a DAG of thoughts with `GotOperation::{Generate, Aggregate, Refine, KeepBest}`. `GraphOfThoughtEngine.run` executes an operation plan over a frontier using caller-supplied sync `ThoughtGenerator`/`ThoughtScorer`/`ThoughtAggregator` traits (with mocks). 55 tests.
- **Skeleton-of-Thought** (feature `skeleton-of-thought`): Ning et al. 2023. Two-stage generation — produce an answer skeleton (point headers) then expand each point independently, joining into the final answer. `SkeletonOfThoughtEngine.run` over `SkeletonGenerator`/`PointExpander` traits. 48 tests.
- **Program-of-Thoughts** (feature `program-of-thought`): Chen et al. 2022. Separates reasoning from computation via a real arithmetic DSL — `parse_program()` is a recursive-descent parser (standard precedence, parentheses, unary minus) and `Interpreter.eval()` executes assignments/return over a variable environment (div-by-zero & undefined-variable errors). `ProgramOfThoughtEngine.run` generates → parses → evaluates. 74 tests.

#### Theme 4 — Verification & Robustness

- **Fact Check** (feature `fact-check`): FEVER-style verification. `FactChecker.verify()` retrieves evidence sentences and assigns a `Verdict` (Supports / Refutes / NotEnoughInfo) from lexical overlap + contradiction detection (negation mismatch, number conflicts), with confidence + rationale. Distinct from `hallucination_detector` (Jaccard claim-support). 60 tests.
- **Noise Filter** (feature `noise-filter`): RAAT-inspired robustness. `NoiseFilter.filter()` scores each passage's query relevance + consensus alignment (similarity to the set centroid), flags distractors, and drops them while keeping at least `keep_min`. Distinct from redundancy filtering (`context_compression`). 53 tests.
- **Answer Calibration** (feature `answer-calibration`): answer-level confidence calibration + metrics. `AnswerCalibrator.estimate_confidence()` blends verbalized confidence (parses "90%"/hedges), self-agreement, and retrieval support; free functions `compute_metrics`/`expected_calibration_error`/`brier_score` produce ECE/MCE/Brier + a reliability diagram; `fit_platt()` fits a logistic calibration map. 81 tests.

- **Four v0.14.0 theme umbrella features**: `retrieval-indexing`, `ranking-fusion`, `structured-reasoning`, `verification-robustness`.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-14

Twelve new cutting-edge RAG technique modules across four themes — Index-Time Representation,
Reranking & Result-Set Selection, Compositional Reasoning, and Calibration/Uncertainty/Geometry —
all pure-Rust heuristic implementations with zero new dependencies.

### Added

#### Theme 1 — Index-Time Representation

- **Late Chunking** (feature `late-chunking`, depends on `chunking`): Jina AI 2024. Embeds the whole document into contextual token vectors *first*, then pools each chunk's token span ("late" pooling) so every chunk embedding carries document context. `LateChunker.encode_document()` blends per-token FNV-1a base embeddings with the document mean by `context_weight`, tiles `chunk_size_tokens` spans with `overlap_tokens`, and pools (`Mean`/`Max`). `naive_chunks()` provides the context-free baseline; `context_weight = 0` makes late ≡ naive. 58 tests.
- **Proposition Retrieval** (feature `proposition-retrieval`): Chen et al. 2023 Dense-X. Decomposes passages into atomic, self-contained propositions via clause splitting + pronoun resolution (`HeuristicPropositionExtractor`), indexes propositions → parent docs (`PropositionIndex`), and retrieves via best-matching proposition. `search()` returns `PropositionHit`s; `search_documents()` dedupes to the best proposition per parent. 59 tests.
- **Doc2Query Expansion** (feature `doc2query`): Nogueira et al. doc2query/HyPE index-time expansion. `HeuristicQueryGenerator` generates hypothetical questions a passage answers (definitional / factoid / relational families over TF-salient terms and capitalized entities). `Doc2QueryExpander.expand()` / `to_indexable_document()` append generated queries to passage text for re-indexing. 48 tests.

#### Theme 2 — Reranking & Result-Set Selection

- **Listwise Reranking** (feature `listwise-rerank`): Sun et al. 2023 RankGPT. Sliding-window listwise permutation reranking — slide a window from the back of the list to the front, permuting each window via `ListwiseJudge` (`LexicalListwiseJudge` scores by window-local IDF + token overlap). `ListwiseReranker.rerank()` returns `ListwiseResult`s with original/new ranks; guards `step = 0` and `window ≥ n`. 55 tests.
- **Autocut** (feature `autocut`): Weaviate-style relevance-gap truncation. `AutoCutter.cut()` detects score discontinuities and dynamically truncates the result list. Four `AutoCutStrategy` variants — `Jumps(k)` (cut after k significant gaps), `RelativeThreshold(r)`, `StdDev(s)`, `Knee` (largest single gap) — clamped to `[min_keep, max_keep]`. `cut_with_report()` returns an `AutoCutReport`. 59 tests.
- **Semantic Dedup** (feature `semantic-dedup`): LSH near-duplicate removal distinct from cosine redundancy filtering. SimHash (64-bit, frequency-weighted, Hamming distance) and MinHash (k-shingles, seeded permutations, Jaccard estimate). `SemanticDeduplicator.deduplicate()` clusters near-duplicates via union-find single-linkage and keeps one representative per `KeepPolicy` (`First`/`HighestScore`/`Longest`). 64 tests.

#### Theme 3 — Compositional Reasoning

- **Self-Ask** (feature `self-ask`): Press et al. 2022. Explicit follow-up decomposition — iteratively emit `Follow up:` sub-questions, answer each via a supplied `SubAnswerer`, and compose the final answer. `SelfAskEngine.run<M, A>` is generic over caller-supplied `SelfAskModel` + `SubAnswerer` traits (with mocks); `SelfAskTrace` records every hop. 52 tests (+1 doctest).
- **Self-Consistency** (feature `self-consistency`): Wang et al. 2022. Samples diverse reasoning paths, clusters final answers by semantic equivalence (normalized-string + token-Jaccard single-linkage), and marginalizes — highest-vote cluster wins, confidence = its vote share. `SelfConsistencyEngine.run<S>` / `marginalize()`; `VoteWeighting::{Uniform, ByReasoningLength}`; deterministic tie-breaking. 67 tests (+1 doctest).

- **Node.js bindings** (feature `nodejs`): napi-rs 2.x, exposes `NapiPipeline`, `NapiPipelineBuilder`, `NapiDocument`, `NapiQuery`, `NapiSearchResult`; all async methods return native Promises; build via `@napi-rs/cli` (`npm run build`).
- `package.json` at crate root for npm package `@cool-japan/oxirag` (version 0.6.0).
- `examples/nodejs/quickstart.js`: end-to-end Node.js quickstart (index, count, query, print results).
- `tests/nodejs_smoke.rs`: Rust-side smoke tests (11 test cases) exercising the underlying `Document`/`Query`/`Pipeline` types powering the napi bridge; no Node.js runtime required. Full JS↔Rust integration tests run via `npm test`.
- `build.rs`: calls `napi_build::setup()` which is a no-op for non-Node.js targets and wires N-API linkage when `--features nodejs` is active. Also links `libnapi_stub.so` (weak stubs for all 40 napi_* symbols) for test/bin/example artifacts so `cargo nextest run --all-features` passes without a Node.js runtime in the linker environment.
- `napi_stub.c` + `libnapi_stub.so`: 40 weak-stub definitions of napi C functions; only used at link time for non-cdylib artifacts; real Node.js symbols override them when the `.node` addon is loaded at runtime.
- `src/nodejs/` module tree: `mod.rs`, `types.rs` (`NapiDocument`, `NapiQuery`, `NapiSearchResult`), `pipeline.rs` (`NapiPipeline`, `NapiPipelineOutput`, `NapiSearchResultItem`), `builder.rs` (`NapiPipelineBuilder`).
- `NapiPipeline::search()`: direct Echo-layer search bypassing Speculator and Judge.
- **File refactors (under 2 000-line policy)**: `src/streaming.rs` (1 455 → thin orchestrator + `streaming/{types,wrapper,progress,tests}.rs`); `src/query_expansion.rs` (1 439 → thin orchestrator + 8 sub-files); `src/circuit_breaker.rs` (1 390 → thin orchestrator + 5 sub-files); `src/connection_pool.rs` (1 407 → thin orchestrator + 6 sub-files); all sub-files ≤ 554 lines.
- **Documentation suite**: `docs/adr/` (5 Architecture Decision Records); `docs/layers/` (4 per-layer tutorials); `docs/troubleshooting.md` (555 lines).
- **TypeScript WASM wrapper** (`npm/`): `@cool-japan/oxirag-wasm` npm package with typed `WasmEngine`, Web Worker bridge, and streaming helpers; `npm/package.json`, `npm/tsconfig.json`.

### Codebase Statistics (v0.6.0)

- **Tests**: 1,681 (all passing; +11 nodejs smoke, +8 skipped WASM/network tests)
- **Clippy Warnings**: 0
- **Rustdoc Warnings**: 0
- **New features**: `nodejs`
- **New files**: `build.rs`, `napi_stub.c`, `libnapi_stub.so`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `src/nodejs/mod.rs`, `src/nodejs/types.rs`, `src/nodejs/pipeline.rs`, `src/nodejs/builder.rs`, `tests/nodejs_smoke.rs`, `examples/nodejs/quickstart.js`, `npm/` (TypeScript WASM wrapper), `docs/adr/` (5 ADRs), `docs/layers/` (4 tutorials), `docs/troubleshooting.md`

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Python bindings** (feature `python`): PyO3 0.28 + pyo3-async-runtimes 0.28; exposes `PyPipeline`, `PyPipelineBuilder`, `PyDocument`, `PyQuery`, `PySearchResult`, `PyPipelineOutput`, `PyDraft`, `PySpanReport`; async bridge via `future_into_py`; buildable with maturin.
- **WASM IndexedDB stack**: `IndexedDbVectorStore` + `IndexedDbPrefixCache` backed by the browser IndexedDB API (features `wasm-indexeddb`, `wasm-prefix-indexeddb`); `WasmRagEngine::query_stream` returning a `ReadableStream`; Web Worker entry (`wasm_worker.rs`); bundle-size optimisation profile (`release-wasm`).
- **Docker distribution**: multi-stage `Dockerfile` (`debian:12-slim` runtime, < 50 MB image); `oxirag-server` binary configured via env vars (`OXIRAG_HOST`, `OXIRAG_PORT`, `OXIRAG_DIMENSION`); `docker-compose.yml` with Jaeger all-in-one OTel integration; `docs/docker.md` container deployment guide.
- **Performance tuning guide**: `docs/perf.md` covering SIMD backend selection, redb vs in-memory tradeoffs, cache sizing, speculator tuning, and observability overhead.
- **`docs/docker.md`**: full container deployment guide (prerequisites, build, run, env vars, health check, OTel, REST API examples, persistence, image-size tips, troubleshooting).
- **`tests/trait_bounds_native.rs`**: compile-time assertions that `EmbeddingProvider`, `VectorStore`, and `PrefixCacheStore` remain `Send + Sync` on native targets.
- **`[[bin]] oxirag-server`** in `Cargo.toml`: standalone REST server binary (`src/bin/oxirag-server.rs`, required-features `rest-server`).
- **`[profile.release-wasm]`**: dedicated Cargo profile inheriting `release` with `panic = "abort"`, `strip = true`, `opt-level = "z"`.
- **`[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]`**: `wasm-opt = ["-Oz", "--enable-bulk-memory"]` for minimal WASM bundles.

### Changed

- `VectorStore`, `Echo`, `EmbeddingProvider`, `MultiModalEmbeddingProvider` traits: now use `#[cfg_attr(target_arch = "wasm32", async_trait(?Send))]` so WASM implementations can use `JsValue` without requiring `Send`. Callers that need `Send + Sync` can add those bounds themselves.
- `PrefixCacheStore` and `PrefixCacheExt`: same cfg-gated async_trait pattern. The `PrefixCacheExt` blanket impl is split into two cfg'd blocks (`not(wasm32)` requires `+ Send`, `wasm32` drops the `Send` bound).
- `web-sys` optional dependency: expanded feature list to include IndexedDB types, Web Worker types, and Streaming types required by `wasm-indexeddb` / `wasm-prefix-indexeddb` features.
- `pyo3 = "0.28"` and `pyo3-async-runtimes = "0.28"` added as optional deps for the `python` feature.

### Fixed

- Nothing (zero issues carried over from v0.4.0).

- **New files**: `src/bin/oxirag-server.rs`, `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docs/docker.md`, `tests/trait_bounds_native.rs`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- **Build fix**: `redb 4.x` migration — added `use redb::ReadableDatabase` to three redb-backed files (`prefix_cache/redb_backend.rs`, `layer4_graph/redb_store.rs`, `layer1_echo/storage/redb.rs`); resolves 20 build errors caused by `begin_read()` moving to a trait in redb 4.0.

- **Observability wiring** (`observability/mod.rs`, `pipeline.rs`):
  - New `SpanObserver` trait: `on_layer_complete(&LayerSpanRecord)` + `on_pipeline_complete(&PipelineSpanContext)`

  - `PipelineSpanContext::add_observer(Arc<dyn SpanObserver>)` + `finalize()`
  - `PipelineBuilder::with_observers(Vec<Arc<dyn SpanObserver>>)` builder method
  - `Pipeline::process()` now creates a `PipelineSpanContext` per query and wraps each layer in RAII spans
  - 5 new observer tests (error, skip, multiple-observer, finalize paths)

- **OpenTelemetry feature** (`src/observability/otel.rs`, feature `otel`):
  - `OtelSpanObserver` implements `SpanObserver` by emitting OTel spans per layer and per pipeline

  - Dependencies: `opentelemetry 0.32`, `opentelemetry_sdk 0.32`, `opentelemetry-otlp 0.32`, `opentelemetry-stdout 0.32`, `tonic 0.14`
  - 7 new tests
  - Example: `examples/otel_tracing.rs`

- **Multi-modal embeddings** (`src/layer1_echo/embedding/clip.rs`, feature `multimodal`):
  - New `EmbeddingInput<'a>` enum: `Text`, `Image`, `TextAndImage`
  - New `MultiModalEmbeddingProvider` async trait (blanket impl makes it a drop-in `EmbeddingProvider`)
  - `CandleClipProvider`: CLIP-based provider (text encoder + vision encoder) using `candle-transformers`
  - Presets: `ClipPreset::VitBase32` (512-dim, default), `VitLarge14` (768-dim), `VitLarge14_336` (768-dim 336px)
  - L2-normalised output; joint text+image embeddings via projection-head averaging
  - Dependency: `image = "0.25"` (optional)
  - 25+ new tests; network-dependent tests skip unless `OXIRAG_TEST_DOWNLOADS=1`
  - Example: `examples/multimodal_search.rs` (mock provider, no download required)

- **REST server module** (`src/rest_server.rs`, feature `rest-server`):
  - `AppState`, `build_router(AppState) -> axum::Router`, `build_and_serve(ServerConfig)`
  - Routes: `GET /health`, `POST /documents`, `POST /search`, `GET /metrics`, `POST /pipeline/query`
  - Every handler uses `PipelineSpanContext` with named layer spans fed to `MemoryObserver`
  - Dependencies: `axum 0.8`, `tower 0.5`, `tower-http 0.6` (all optional)
  - 19 new tests via `tower::ServiceExt::oneshot`
  - Example: `examples/rest_server.rs`

- **Integration test suite** (`tests/` directory — previously did not exist):
  - `tests/pipeline_e2e.rs` — 4 cross-layer pipeline E2E tests (echo-only, batch, empty store, observer integration)
  - `tests/persistence_redb.rs` — 3 persistence round-trip tests (vector store, graph store, prefix cache) using `tempfile::TempDir`; gated on `full` feature
  - `tests/observability_e2e.rs` — 5 observer integration tests (fires, layer name, duration, finalize, multi-observer)
  - `tests/multimodal.rs` — trait-bound compile checks (no model downloads)

- **Proptest fuzz harness** (`tests/fuzz_*.rs`):
  - `tests/fuzz_claim_extraction.rs` — 6 proptest cases (no-panic, normalizer idempotence, null-byte checks, dedup)
  - `tests/fuzz_query_normalization.rs` — 7 proptest cases (builder, unicode, whitespace, top_k/min_score round-trips)
  - `tests/fuzz_fingerprint.rs` — 8 proptest cases (determinism, prefix_length preservation, reflexivity, collision resistance)

- **Layer 2 + Layer 4 benchmarks** (`benches/benchmarks.rs`):
  - 5 Layer 2 bench fns: Platt calibration, temperature scaling, `RuleBasedSpeculator` verify, single-stage and multi-stage `VerificationPipeline`
  - 5 Layer 4 bench fns: entity insert, `find_by_name`, `find_by_type`, BFS traversal, relationship insert
  - Registered in `criterion_main!` under feature-gated groups

- **Doc coverage improvement** (~60 new `///` blocks):
  - `Pipeline::process`, `process_batch`, `PipelineConfig`, `PipelineBuilder` (with examples)
  - `EchoLayer`, `Echo` trait, `InMemoryVectorStore`, `MockEmbeddingProvider`
  - `WasmRagEngine::query` fully documented

### Fixed

- Flaky `test_load_test_stats_rps` test: `rps > 0.0` assertion replaced with `rps >= 0.0` + count assertion; RPS can legitimately be 0 on extremely fast hardware.
- **WASM pipeline bypass**: `WasmRagEngine::query` now calls `Pipeline::process()` through all 4 layers (was only calling `Echo::search`).

### Changed

- `src/observability.rs` → `src/observability/` module (no public API change).
- `src/simd_similarity.rs` (1662 lines) → `src/simd_similarity/` module: `mod.rs`, `generic.rs`, `neon.rs`, `x86.rs` (all ≤ 1063 lines).
