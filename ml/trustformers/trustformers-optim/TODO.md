# trustformers-optim TODO List

**Version:** 0.2.1 | **Status:** Stable | **Tests:** 1197 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed as of 2026-08-25 (`cargo nextest run -p trustformers-optim --no-fail-fast`, independently re-run — see the 2026-08-25 honesty-pass addendum near the end of this file) | **SLoC:** 65,983 (`tokei`, verified 2026-08-24 — up from 50,431 on 2026-07-09, not re-measured after the 2026-08-25 pass) | **Updated:** 2026-08-25 (production-hardening honesty pass on `performance_validation.rs`/`federated.rs`/`advanced_distributed_features.rs` — see addendum; earlier narrative largely unreviewed since 2026-07-09)

## Overview

The `trustformers-optim` crate provides optimization algorithms, learning rate schedulers, and
distributed/advanced-training infrastructure for the TrustformeRS ecosystem. It spans over 100 modules
(~52,200 lines) — from textbook first-order optimizers through 2024/2025 research algorithms, 4-bit/8-bit
quantized optimizer states, ZeRO/FSDP-style distributed training, federated & continual learning,
hardware-targeted variants, and PyTorch/JAX/TensorFlow compatibility layers.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Standard & research optimizers (SGD, Adam, AdamW, RAdam, NAdam, AdaBelief, LAMB, AdaFactor, AdaFisher,
  AdaMaxPlus, Adan, Lion, Muon, CAME, MicroAdam, BGE-Adam, HN-Adam, AdEMAMix, Prodigy, NovoGrad, LancBiO,
  AMacP, EVA, Ranger/AdaBound/AMSBound, etc.)
- Schedule-Free optimizer variants (`ScheduleFreeAdam`, `ScheduleFreeSGD`)
- 8-bit and 4-bit quantized optimizer states, plus per-layer bit-width selection
- Learning rate schedulers (Linear, Cosine[+Restarts], One-Cycle, Polynomial, cyclic-decay, LR finder, ...)
- Second-order methods (Sophia, L-BFGS, Newton-CG, SSBFGS, SSBroyden)
- ZeRO distributed optimization stages 1/2/3, FSDP-style sharding, multi-node training
- Federated learning (FedAvg, FedProx, differential privacy) and continual learning (EWC, PackNet)
- Hardware-aware variants (GPU/TPU/edge/mobile), kernel fusion, SIMD, cache-friendly layouts
- Cross-framework compatibility (PyTorch, JAX/Optax, TensorFlow) and a universal config converter
- Hyperparameter tuning, optimizer monitoring/recommendation, performance validation, ONNX export,
  optimizer surgery
- Gradient clipping/scaling utilities and optimizer state checkpointing (`state_dict`/`load_state_dict`)

## Current Status

### Implementation Status
- [x] **PRODUCTION-READY** — core optimizers (SGD/Adam/AdamW/LAMB/AdaFactor/RAdam/NAdam/AdaBelief) fully
      implemented and tested
- [x] **BROAD RESEARCH COVERAGE** — Lion, Muon, CAME, MicroAdam, BGE-Adam, HN-Adam, AdEMAMix, Prodigy,
      NovoGrad, LancBiO, AMacP, EVA (2023–2025 algorithms)
- [x] **ZERO COMPILATION ERRORS/WARNINGS** — 0 clippy warnings, 0 rustdoc warnings workspace-wide
- [x] **MEMORY EFFICIENT** — 8-bit/4-bit quantized optimizers, per-layer bit-width selection, ZeRO stages,
      sign-based methods, lazy state allocation
- [x] **SCHEDULE-FREE** — `ScheduleFreeAdam` / `ScheduleFreeSGD` implemented
- [x] **ZERO STAGES 1/2/3** — including an async-communication-overlap variant of stage 3
      (`zero::zero_stage3_overlap`)
- [x] **FSDP-STYLE SHARDING** — `fsdp` module (re-exported at crate root)
- [x] **NO UNWRAP POLICY SATISFIED** — 0 occurrences of `.unwrap()` in any real `.rs` source file
- [ ] **SECOND-ORDER: NO SHAMPOO** — Shampoo/Kronecker-factored preconditioning is not implemented
      (real second-order coverage: Sophia, L-BFGS, Newton-CG, SSBFGS, SSBroyden)

### Test Metrics
- **Test Count:** ~995 tests for this crate (workspace-wide `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features`:
  18,102 passed / 0 failed / 119 skipped)
- **Doctests:** 49 passed, 0 failed, 1 ignored
- **Pass Rate:** 100%
- **Coverage:** Optimizer convergence, scheduler validation, gradient clipping, state save/load,
  quantization accuracy, ZeRO round-trip, Schedule-Free equivalence
- **Numerical Stability:** Extensive testing with edge cases (NaN, Inf, zero gradients)

### Housekeeping / Verified Policy Compliance
- [x] No `.unwrap()` anywhere in real `.rs` source (checked via `grep -rn "\.unwrap()" --include="*.rs" src/`)
- [x] All compiled source files are under the 2000-line refactor threshold — largest is `convergence.rs`
      at 1,964 lines (worth watching; next largest are `performance_validation.rs` at 1,725 and
      `enhanced_distributed_training.rs` at 1,678)
- [x] Delete 3 stray *.prelude_fix backup files (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal/Design: delete src/federated.rs.prelude_fix, src/hyperparameter_tuning.rs.prelude_fix, src/quantum_inspired.rs.prelude_fix — confirmed pre-migration snapshots, zero references, not part of the build graph.
  - Files: the 3 files.
  - Tests: cargo check -p trustformers-optim --all-features (no-op diff).
  - Risk: none.
- [x] Delete 4 orphaned files (adafactor.rs, adafisher.rs, advanced_benchmarking.rs, second_order_new.rs) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal/Design: delete all 4 — adafactor.rs implements a stale non-current Optimizer trait shape (wouldn't compile if mounted); adafisher.rs calls ~8 Tensor methods that don't exist anywhere in trustformers-core (cholesky_inverse, pinverse, diag, eye, etc — wouldn't compile); advanced_benchmarking.rs fabricates every benchmark number while importing-but-never-instantiating 6 real optimizers; second_order_new.rs is pure scaffolding with no Optimizer impl and an inner `pub mod lbfgs;` that doesn't resolve to any real path. All 4 confirmed outside the build graph already.
  - Files: the 4 files.
  - Tests: cargo check/cargo nextest run -p trustformers-optim --all-features (no-op diff).
  - Risk: none for the compiler. These existed as (non-compiling) design references for a future real AdaFisher/Shampoo/KFAC, recoverable via git history if ever wanted.
- [x] Re-export fsdp/optimizer_surgery/per_layer_quant at crate root (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal: FsdpConfig, OptimizerSurgeon, PerLayerQuantSelector, etc (21 types total) reachable at crate root.
  - Design: add 3 pub use blocks to lib.rs, alphabetized, mirroring the existing re-export style.
  - Files: trustformers-optim/src/lib.rs only.
  - Tests: cargo doc --no-deps; a smoke test importing all 3 from the crate root path.
  - Risk: none — zero naming collisions confirmed against the full existing public surface.

## Completed Optimizer Implementations

### Standard Optimizers

#### SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)

- [x] **Algorithm** — `θ ← θ - lr * v` with `v ← momentum * v + ∇L(θ)`, optional Nesterov look-ahead,
      weight decay
- [x] **Features** — momentum, Nesterov momentum, weight decay (L2)

**Real constructor** (`src/sgd.rs`):
```rust
use trustformers_optim::SGD;

// (lr, momentum, weight_decay, nesterov)
let optimizer = SGD::new(0.01, 0.9, 1e-4, true);
```

---

#### Adam / AdamW / RAdam / NAdam / AdaBelief

All five live in `src/adam.rs` and share the same `(lr, betas, eps, weight_decay) -> Self` constructor
shape:

- [x] **Adam** — first/second moment EMA with bias correction
- [x] **AdamW** — decoupled weight decay (recommended default for transformers)
- [x] **RAdam** — rectified variance with automatic warmup
- [x] **NAdam** — Nesterov-accelerated Adam
- [x] **AdaBelief** — second moment tracks "belief" in the gradient direction

```rust
use trustformers_optim::{Adam, AdamW, RAdam, NAdam, AdaBelief};

let adam    = Adam::new(1e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.0);
let adamw   = AdamW::new(1e-4, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.01);
let radam   = RAdam::new(1e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.0);
let nadam   = NAdam::new(1e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.0);
let adabelief = AdaBelief::new(1e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.0);
```

---

#### LAMB (Layer-wise Adaptive Moments)

- [x] Trust-ratio scaled Adam-style update for large-batch training

```rust
use trustformers_optim::LAMB;

let optimizer = LAMB::new(2e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-6, 0.01);
```

---

#### AdaFactor

- [x] Factored second-moment estimate, ~75% memory reduction vs Adam

```rust
use trustformers_optim::AdaFactor;

let optimizer = AdaFactor::new(); // default configuration
```

---

#### AdaFisher, AdaMaxPlus, Adan

- [x] **AdaFisher** — block-diagonal Fisher-information preconditioning (ICLR 2025)
- [x] **AdaMaxPlus** — infinity-norm-based adaptive learning rate variant
- [x] **Adan** — Nesterov-accelerated adaptive optimizer

#### ~~AdaGrad / RMSProp~~ — not implemented

Earlier revisions of this document claimed AdaGrad and RMSProp were implemented. Verified against
source: **neither exists** as a struct or re-export anywhere in the crate. `optimizer_surgery.rs` uses
"RMSProp" only as a state-snapshot label for migration purposes, not as an actual optimizer
implementation. Removed from the checklist; add back only if genuinely implemented.

---

### Cutting-Edge Research Optimizers

#### Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum)
- [x] Sign-based update; only first-moment buffer (no variance state)
```rust
use trustformers_optim::Lion;
let optimizer = Lion::new(1e-4, (0.9, 0.99), 0.1); // (lr, betas, weight_decay)
```

#### Muon (Momentum + Orthogonalization)
- [x] Nesterov momentum + Newton-Schulz orthogonalization of 2D updates
```rust
use trustformers_optim::Muon;
let optimizer = Muon::new();                 // default config
let optimizer = Muon::new_with_lr(2e-4);      // custom learning rate
let optimizer = Muon::for_nanogpt();          // preset
let optimizer = Muon::for_large_lm();         // preset
```

#### CAME (Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory-Efficient)
- [x] Confidence-guided second moment, AdaFactor-sized memory footprint
```rust
use trustformers_optim::{CameConfig, CameOptimizer};
let optimizer = CameOptimizer::new(CameConfig::default());
```

#### MicroAdam
- [x] Gradient compression with error-feedback accumulation
```rust
use trustformers_optim::MicroAdam;
let optimizer = MicroAdam::new();
let optimizer = MicroAdam::for_large_models();
let optimizer = MicroAdam::for_memory_constrained();
```

#### BGE-Adam / OptimizedBGEAdam
- [x] Entropy-weighted bias correction; `OptimizedBGEAdam` is a reported 3–5x faster reimplementation
```rust
use trustformers_optim::{BGEAdam, OptimizedBGEAdam};
let optimizer = OptimizedBGEAdam::new();              // recommended
let original  = BGEAdam::new(1e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.01, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05);
```

#### HN-Adam (Hybrid-Norm Adam)
- [x] Adaptive step size based on update-norm history
```rust
use trustformers_optim::HNAdam;
// (lr, betas, eps, weight_decay, adaptation_threshold)
let optimizer = HNAdam::new(1e-3, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.01, 0.1);
let optimizer = HNAdam::for_transformers();
```

#### AdEMAMix
- [x] Mixes fast (β1) and slow (β3) EMAs of the gradient
```rust
use trustformers_optim::AdEMAMix;
let optimizer = AdEMAMix::new();
let optimizer = AdEMAMix::new_with_params(1e-4, 0.01); // (lr, weight_decay)
let optimizer = AdEMAMix::for_llm_training();
```

#### Prodigy, NovoGrad, LancBiO, AMacP, EVA
- [x] Additional adaptive/variance-reduced optimizers, each with their own `*Config` type
      (`ProdigyConfig`, `NovoGradConfig`, `LancBiOConfig`, `AMacPConfig`, `EVAConfig`)

#### GENIE, LoRA-RITE, SOFO
- [x] Functional and tested (real momentum-style parameter updates, not `unimplemented!()`/`todo!()`)
- **Corrected 2026-08-24**: this section previously described these as living in `src/genie_stub.rs`, `src/lora_rite_stub.rs`, `src/sofo_stub.rs`, self-documenting as simplified/pending implementations, with stats getters (e.g. `GENIE::get_osgr_stats`) "currently return[ing] empty placeholders". None of that holds today: the files are `src/genie.rs`, `src/lora_rite.rs`, `src/sofo.rs` (no `_stub` suffix — renamed at some point, not tracked to a specific wave in this pass); none of their module doc comments carry "simplified"/"pending"/"placeholder"/"stub"/"TODO" language (checked by direct grep); and `GENIE::get_osgr_stats` computes a real per-parameter mean from `self.state.osgr_ema` rather than returning an empty map by construction (it can be empty only if there's genuinely no OSGR data yet, which is a legitimate empty-input case, not a placeholder). Full paper-fidelity for all three was not independently re-assessed this pass — only the specific "stub"/"empty placeholder" claims above, which no longer hold.

---

### Schedule-Free Optimizer Variants

- [x] **`ScheduleFreeAdam`** — folds scheduling into primal-dual iterate averaging
- [x] **`ScheduleFreeSGD`** — same approach applied to momentum SGD

> Earlier revisions of this document referenced a type called `ScheduleFreeAdamW`. It does not exist;
> the real, exported type is `ScheduleFreeAdam`.

```rust
use trustformers_optim::ScheduleFreeAdam;

let optimizer = ScheduleFreeAdam::for_language_models();
// or fully custom: (learning_rate, beta1, beta2, epsilon, weight_decay)
let optimizer = ScheduleFreeAdam::new(0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1e-8, 0.1);
```

---

### Quantized Optimizers

#### Adam8bit / AdamW8bit
- [x] 8-bit optimizer state, ~4x memory reduction
```rust
use trustformers_optim::Adam8bit;
let optimizer = Adam8bit::new(1e-4); // single-argument constructor (learning_rate)
```

#### Adam4bit
- [x] 4-bit optimizer state via `QuantizationMethod` (e.g. NF4), ~8x memory reduction
- [x] Add AdamW4bit mirroring Adam4bit, with decoupled weight decay — **done, verified 2026-08-24**: `AdamW4bit` exists in `src/quantized_advanced.rs` with real `Optimizer`/`StatefulOptimizer` impls and 3 tests; not tracked to a specific wave in this pass (planned 2026-07-05, completed sometime before 2026-08-24)
  - Goal: AdamW4bit alongside the existing Adam4bit, with decoupled (AdamW-style) weight decay instead of Adam4bit's coupled decay.
  - Design: structurally mirror Adam4bit exactly (same QuantizedTensor/NF4 block-wise quantization — this crate's "4-bit" storage is f32-backed with codebook values, not literally nibble-packed; that's a pre-existing crate-wide simplification, out of scope to fix here). Only formula difference: apply weight decay directly to the parameter before the Adam update, instead of folding it into the gradient. Implement a COMPLETE load_state_dict — Adam4bit's own version was found broken (only restores learning_rate) — do not copy that bug.
  - Files: trustformers-optim/src/quantized_advanced.rs (new struct+impl), lib.rs (extend existing pub use block).
  - Tests: creation test; numerical-divergence test (decoupled vs coupled decay diverge under nonzero weight_decay); state_dict/load_state_dict round-trip test (the regression test that would have caught Adam4bit's bug); integration test round-tripping through the save_state/load_state trait defaults below.
  - Risk: must reuse the exact same NF4 quantize/dequantize utilities Adam4bit uses — don't invent a third quantization scheme.
```rust
use trustformers_optim::Adam4bit;
// (lr, beta1, beta2, eps, weight_decay)
let optimizer = Adam4bit::new(1e-4, 0.9, 0.999, 1e-8, 0.01);
```

#### Per-layer bit-width selection
- [x] `per_layer_quant.rs` (807 lines) — `BitWidth::{Int2,Int4,Int8,Fp16,Fp32}`, sensitivity analysis,
      memory-budget-constrained assignment (re-exported at crate root)

---

### Learning Rate Schedulers

All scheduler constructors return `Self` directly (no `Result`/`?`).

```rust
use trustformers_optim::{LinearScheduler, CosineWithRestartsScheduler, OneCycleScheduler};

let linear = LinearScheduler::new(5e-5, 10_000, 100_000); // (base_lr, warmup_steps, total_steps)

// (base_lr, min_lr, t_0, t_mult)
let cosine_restarts = CosineWithRestartsScheduler::new(1e-3, 1e-6, 1000, 2.0);

// (max_lr, total_steps, pct_start, final_lr)
let one_cycle = OneCycleScheduler::new(1e-3, 10_000, 0.3, 1e-6);
```

- [x] Linear, Polynomial, Step, Exponential, Constant+Warmup
- [x] Cosine and Cosine-with-Warm-Restarts (SGDR-style)
- [x] One-Cycle (`OneCycleScheduler`) plus a separate cyclic-decay implementation
      (`cyclic_decay::{CyclicLrScheduler, OneCycleLrScheduler}`) with `Triangular` / `Triangular2` /
      `ExpRange` amplitude modes
- [x] Adaptive, Composite, Cyclical, Dynamic, Phase-based, Task-specific schedulers
- [x] **Automatic LR Finder** — `LrFinder` + `LrFinderConfig` + `LrFinderResult` + `find_optimal_lr`
      (`lr_finder.rs`)

---

### Second-Order Methods

- [x] **Sophia** — Hutchinson's-estimator Hessian diagonal preconditioning, updated every k steps
- [x] **L-BFGS** (`LBFGS`) and **Newton-CG** (`NewtonCG`) — classic quasi-Newton / Newton-CG line search
- [x] **Self-Scaled BFGS / Broyden** (`SSBFGS`, `SSBroyden`, 2025) — with `for_physics_informed()` /
      `for_non_convex()` presets for PINN-style training

> **Correction:** earlier revisions of this document listed "Shampoo" (Kronecker-factored curvature) as
> implemented. It is not — the only occurrence of the word "Shampoo" in the source tree is a comparison
> reference in a doc comment (`src/lora_rite.rs`) and in the orphaned, uncompiled `second_order_new.rs`.

---

### Advanced Features

#### Gradient Clipping
```rust
use trustformers_optim::GradientProcessor;

let mut grad = vec![3.0_f32, 4.0, 0.0];
GradientProcessor::clip_by_norm(&mut grad, 1.0);        // clip by global L2 norm
GradientProcessor::clip_by_value(&mut grad, -0.5, 0.5); // element-wise clip
```
> These are associated functions operating on `&mut [f32]`, not instance methods on the optimizer types
> as earlier revisions of this document showed.

#### Weight Decay
- [x] L2 regularization and AdamW-style decoupled weight decay (`WeightDecayMode`)

#### Gradient Accumulation
- [x] `Optimizer::accumulate_grad` has a default implementation (delegates to `update`); optimizers may
      override it for specialized accumulation logic

#### Optimizer State Management
- [x] `StatefulOptimizer::state_dict(&self) -> Result<HashMap<String, Tensor>>` and
      `load_state_dict(&mut self, state: HashMap<String, Tensor>) -> Result<()>`
- [x] Add save_state/load_state default trait methods on StatefulOptimizer — **done, verified 2026-08-24**: `StatefulOptimizer` (`traits.rs`) provides default `save_state`/`load_state` methods with a round-trip regression test; not tracked to a specific wave in this pass (planned 2026-07-05, completed sometime before 2026-08-24)
  - Goal: every one of the ~29 StatefulOptimizer implementors gets a working save_state(path)/load_state(path) for free.
  - Design: add a small private TensorSnapshot { data: Vec<f32>, shape: Vec<usize> } type (derive Serialize/Deserialize) to traits.rs — needed because Tensor itself has no Serialize/Deserialize impl anywhere in trustformers-core. Add 2 default trait methods on StatefulOptimizer: save_state converts state_dict()'s HashMap<String,Tensor> to HashMap<String,TensorSnapshot>, encodes with oxicode::serde::encode_to_vec (NOT bincode, per COOLJAPAN policy — already a declared-but-unused workspace dependency of this crate), writes to disk; load_state reverses it. Mirror the existing oxicode save/load pattern already used in trustformers-core/src/checkpoint/formats.rs and trustformers-tokenizers/src/binary_format.rs.
  - Files: trustformers-optim/src/traits.rs only.
  - Tests: round-trip test using a real optimizer (AdamW) against std::env::temp_dir(); multi-dimensional-shape round-trip; error-path test (nonexistent path returns Err, not panic).
  - Risk: document explicitly this is a private, crate-internal binary layout, not a cross-framework checkpoint format (this crate has separate pytorch_compat.rs/cross_framework.rs files — a reader could otherwise assume interoperability that doesn't exist).

#### Parameter Groups
- [x] Per-group learning rates and hyperparameters supported across the standard optimizers

---

## Distributed & Scaled Training

### ZeRO (stages 1/2/3)
- [x] `ZeROOptimizer<T: Optimizer>` wraps a base optimizer; `ZeROConfig` controls `stage`
      (`ZeROStage::{Stage1,Stage2,Stage3}`), `bucket_size_mb`, `overlap_comm`, `reduce_bucket_size`,
      `prefetch_depth`, `max_memory_usage_mb`, `gradient_compression`, `pin_memory`
- [x] `zero::zero_stage3_overlap` — async prefetch/overlap of communication with backward-pass compute
      for stage 3 (this substantially satisfies the former "better async communication overlap for ZeRO
      stage 3" future item — see below)

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use trustformers_optim::{AdamW, ZeROConfig, ZeROOptimizer, ZeROStage};

let zero_config = ZeROConfig { stage: ZeROStage::Stage3, ..Default::default() };
let base_optimizer = AdamW::new(1e-4, (0.9, 0.999), 1e-8, 0.01);
let mut optimizer = ZeROOptimizer::new(base_optimizer, zero_config, mp_context)?;
optimizer.register_parameters(parameters)?;
```

> **Correction:** earlier revisions used `ZeroOptimizer`/`ZeroConfig`/`ZeroStage` (wrong casing) and
> config fields (`partition_gradients`, `contiguous_gradients`, `reduce_scatter`, `cpu_offload`) that do
> not exist on the real `ZeROConfig`. The constructor also does not take a `model` argument directly;
> parameters are registered separately via `register_parameters`.

### FSDP-style sharding
- [x] `fsdp` module: `FsdpConfig`, `ShardingStrategy`, `WrappingPolicy`, `FsdpUnit`, `FsdpState`,
      `FsdpMemoryAnalyzer` (re-exported at crate root)

### Multi-node training
- [x] `MultiNodeTrainer` / `MultiNodeConfig` / `MultiNodeStats`

### Enhanced distributed trainer
- [x] `EnhancedDistributedTrainer` + `DistributedConfig` (builder methods `.with_gpus()`,
      `.with_gradient_compression(CompressionType::PowerSGD { rank })`, `.with_dynamic_batching()`,
      `.with_fault_tolerance()`), gradient compression, dynamic batching, fault tolerance
- [x] `advanced_distributed_features`: `AutoScaler`, `PerformanceMLOptimizer`, `SmartCheckpointManager`
      (auto-scaling, ML-based performance tuning, differential checkpointing) — `AutoScaler`
      **honesty-audited 2026-08-25.** Before this pass, `execute_scale_up`/`execute_scale_down` (reached
      from `update_and_scale`) unconditionally mutated `current_nodes` and pushed a `ScalingEvent` for a
      compute fleet that did not exist — no node was ever actually requested or terminated. Fixed via a
      `NodeProvider` trait (the cluster-provisioning callback this workspace has no real substrate for,
      same pattern as `elastic_training::WorkerProvisioner` in `trustformers-training`): without one
      attached via `AutoScaler::with_node_provider`, `update_and_scale` now returns
      `TrustformersError::invalid_state` whenever it decides to scale up/down, instead of fabricating
      success; `current_nodes`/`get_scaling_history` are updated with exactly the count the provider
      reports actually provisioning/terminating (even under partial provisioning, which is still reported
      as an error). A `SimulatedNodeProvider` is provided for callers that explicitly want a labelled
      dry run (benchmarks/demos/tests) instead of a real substrate. Separately (found on a second honesty
      pass over this same fix): the recorded `ScalingEvent::reason` was ALSO fabricated -- hardcoded to
      `"Performance threshold exceeded"`/`"Low utilization detected"` regardless of which of the four
      `ScalingStrategy` variants actually produced the decision, so `get_scaling_history()` reported a
      false trigger for `QueueBased`/`Predictive`/`CostOptimized` scaling (only `Performance` was ever
      accidentally correct). Fixed: `performance_based_scaling`/`queue_based_scaling`/
      `predictive_scaling`/`cost_optimized_scaling` now each return `(ScalingDecision, String)`, building
      the reason from the actual values that drove the decision (mirroring
      `elastic_training::ScalingDecision::reason`'s `format!("High utilization: {:.2}", ...)` pattern);
      `execute_scale_up`/`execute_scale_down` record whatever reason the firing strategy actually
      computed. 8 new tests cover the honest contract: 6 for the `NodeProvider` fix, 2 proving the
      recorded reason names the strategy that actually fired (`QueueBased`/`CostOptimized`) rather than
      the old hardcoded strings.
      **Known follow-up (deferred, out of ownership):** `examples/comprehensive_distributed_training_benchmarks.rs`
      constructs `AutoScaler` with no provider and calls `update_and_scale` in a loop expecting `Ok` on
      every step; it still compiles, but now returns `Err` the first time a scale-up/down decision fires.
      Needs `.with_node_provider(Arc::new(advanced_distributed_features::SimulatedNodeProvider::new()))`
      added where the `AutoScaler` is constructed (~L796) to keep it a running simulation instead of
      erroring out.

### Asynchronous / staleness-tolerant training
- [x] `Hogwild`, `ElasticAveraging`, `ParameterServer`, `AsyncSGD`, `DelayedGradient` (with configurable
      `DelayCompensationMethod`)

### Hierarchical aggregation & deep distributed QP
- [x] `HierarchicalAggregator` (ring / tree / butterfly communication topologies)
- [x] `DeepDistributedQP`

---

## Federated & Continual Learning

- [x] **FedAvg**, **FedProx** — federated averaging / proximal-term federated optimization
- [x] **Differential privacy** (`DifferentialPrivacy`, configurable `NoiseMechanism`) and
      **secure aggregation** (`SecureAggregation`) — **honesty-audited 2026-08-25.**
      `SecureAggregation::generate_masks` previously built masks for hardcoded shapes
      (`[100,50]`/`[50]`/`[50,20]`/`[20]`) unrelated to any caller's model, and its per-client
      independently-seeded masks did not actually cancel on summation despite `secure_aggregate`'s
      comment claiming they did (the sum carried the masks' own mean as bias). Fixed: `generate_masks` now
      takes the caller's real `parameter_shapes` plus the round's `all_client_ids`, and implements the
      standard pairwise-masking construction (Bonawitz et al.) — for every other participating client, both
      sides derive the same PRG seed and add/subtract the same values by a deterministic sign rule, so
      summing every participant's mask cancels exactly (to floating-point rounding). `secure_aggregate`'s
      doc comment now states precisely what this protects (server never sees an individual update) and
      what it does not (no secret-sharing-based dropout recovery — a missing participant's masks are not
      cancelled and bias the result; `threshold` only checks a client count, not that the update set
      matches a `generate_masks` call). Both functions still have zero in-tree callers. 5 new tests,
      including one proving two clients' masks are exact (bit-for-bit) negatives of each other and one
      proving `secure_aggregate` recovers the true average of real per-client updates through the masks.

## Hardware-Aware & Performance

- [x] GPU / TPU / edge / mobile optimizer variants (`GPUAdam`, `TPUOptimizer`, `EdgeOptimizer`,
      `MobileOptimizer`)
- [x] GPU kernel fusion (`kernel_fusion::KernelFusedAdam`) — fused momentum/variance/parameter-update
      kernels, tensor-core-aware
- [x] SIMD optimizations, cache-friendly layouts, aligned memory layout (`SIMDOptimizer`,
      `CacheFriendlyAdam`, `LayoutOptimizedAdam`, `AlignedAllocator`)
- [x] CPU offload (`CPUOffloadedOptimizer`) and lazy state allocation (`LazyAdam` — allocates moment
      buffers only once the first gradient is seen, `lazy_state.rs`)

## Cross-Framework Compatibility

- [x] PyTorch-style (`PyTorchAdam`, `PyTorchAdamW`, `PyTorchSGD`, `PyTorchLRScheduler`)
- [x] JAX/Optax-style (`JAXAdam`, `JAXAdamW`, `JAXSGD`, `JAXGradientTransformation`, `JAXChain`)
- [x] TensorFlow-style (`TensorFlowAdam`, `TensorFlowAdamW`, `TensorFlowCosineDecay`)
- [x] Universal cross-framework config converter (`CrossFrameworkConverter`, `UniversalOptimizerConfig`)

## Tooling

- [x] **Hyperparameter tuning** — native `BayesianOptimizer` + `MultiObjectiveOptimizer` +
      `HyperparameterTuner` (this substantially satisfies the former "automatic hyperparameter tuning
      integration" future item — see below; it is a built-in implementation, not an Optuna/Ray-Tune
      integration)
- [x] **Monitoring & recommendation** — `OptimizerMonitor`, `OptimizerSelector`, `ConvergenceIndicators`
- [x] **Performance validation harness** — `PerformanceValidator` (correctness, convergence, memory,
      regression, and distributed-training validation) — **honesty-audited 2026-08-25.**
      `StatisticalAnalyzer::analyze` previously returned `p_value: 0.05` as a hardcoded constant for
      every input; separately, `MathematicalProperty::SparsityHandling` was an undisclosed alias for
      `Convergence` ("assume true if convergence is achieved"). Fixed: `analyze` now takes an optional
      `target_step_time` and, when given one, computes a real two-sided one-sample Student-t p-value
      (via `trustformers_core::statistics`, the exact-Student-t primitives already used elsewhere in this
      workspace, not a normal approximation) against it; `StatisticalMetrics::p_value` is `Option<f64>`,
      `None` when there is no target. `benchmark_optimizer` (the only caller) threads its optimizer's
      matching entry from `PerformanceValidator::baseline_results` (set via `set_baseline`) through as
      that target — a real, already-existing signal, keyed by optimizer name so a baseline for one
      optimizer cannot leak into another's test. `SparsityHandling` now checks something real: that the
      parameter update produced by an exactly-zero gradient (decaying momentum / decoupled weight decay
      only, since there is no new signal) stays finite and does not grow step over step, independent of
      whether the run converged. 7 new tests across both fixes: 5 for the p-value fix, including two
      proving the p-value actually responds to the data (a target matching the sample is not significant;
      a target 100x the sample mean is) and an integration test proving `benchmark_optimizer` only uses a
      baseline keyed to the matching optimizer name; 2 for `SparsityHandling`, proving it is no longer an
      alias for `Convergence` (a scenario that genuinely converges but never exercises a zero-gradient
      step must now fail `SparsityHandling` while still passing `Convergence`) and that the built-in
      "Sparse Gradient Handling" test case's real zero-gradient steps genuinely satisfy the new check.

## Known Limitations

- Shampoo-style Kronecker-factored preconditioning is **not implemented** (see Second-Order Methods
  correction above).
- `GENIE`, `LoRARITE`, and `SOFO` are simplified reference implementations, not full paper-fidelity
  ports; some introspection getters return placeholder/empty values.
- ~27 modules carry an explicit `#[allow(dead_code)]` "research-stage module" annotation (e.g.
  `kernel_fusion`, `federated`, `hyperparameter_tuning`, `zero::zero_stage1`, `came`, `prodigy`,
  `advanced_2025_research`) — these compile and are tested, but some fields/methods are scaffolding
  not yet on every active call path.
- ZeRO stage 3 with CPU offload adds host-device transfer overhead.
- 4-bit quantized optimizers may diverge on tasks with very noisy gradients.
- AdaGrad and RMSProp are **not implemented** despite being listed in earlier revisions of this document.

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Additional emerging optimizers as they appear (2025+): SOAP and Adam-mini/Grokfast-style methods
      are still **not implemented** (Muon, previously on this list, is now done — see above)
- [x] ~~Enhanced distributed optimizer state management with async overlap~~ — substantially addressed
      by `zero::zero_stage3_overlap` (async prefetch/overlap of communication with backward-pass compute)
- [x] ~~Automatic hyperparameter tuning integration~~ — addressed via the native `hyperparameter_tuning`
      module (Bayesian + multi-objective search); not integrated with external frameworks
      (Optuna/Ray Tune) if that specific integration is still desired

### Performance
- [~] Fused quantized optimizer kernels for GPU — `kernel_fusion::KernelFusedAdam` provides fused,
      tensor-core-aware GPU kernels for the Adam family, but they are not yet specialized for 4-bit/8-bit
      quantized state specifically
- [x] **Lazy optimizer state allocation** — `LazyAdam` allocates moment buffers only when first gradient
      is seen (`lazy_state.rs`)
- [x] ~~Better async communication overlap for ZeRO stage 3~~ — see `zero::zero_stage3_overlap` above

### Features
- [x] **Cyclic LR with decay** — `CyclicLrScheduler` (Triangular/Triangular2/ExpRange) +
      `OneCycleLrScheduler` (`cyclic_decay.rs`)
- [x] **Automatic LR Finder** — `LrFinder` + `LrFinderConfig` + `LrFinderResult` + `find_optimal_lr`
      (`lr_finder.rs`)
- [x] **Optimizer surgery** (change optimizer type mid-training) — `optimizer_surgery.rs` (875 lines);
      re-exported at crate root
- [x] **Per-layer quantization bit-width selection** — `per_layer_quant.rs` (807 lines); re-exported
      at crate root

### Housekeeping (new)
- [x] Delete 3 stray *.prelude_fix backup files (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal/Design: delete src/federated.rs.prelude_fix, src/hyperparameter_tuning.rs.prelude_fix, src/quantum_inspired.rs.prelude_fix — confirmed pre-migration snapshots, zero references, not part of the build graph.
  - Files: the 3 files.
  - Tests: cargo check -p trustformers-optim --all-features (no-op diff).
  - Risk: none.
- [x] Delete 4 orphaned files (adafactor.rs, adafisher.rs, advanced_benchmarking.rs, second_order_new.rs) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal/Design: delete all 4 — adafactor.rs implements a stale non-current Optimizer trait shape (wouldn't compile if mounted); adafisher.rs calls ~8 Tensor methods that don't exist anywhere in trustformers-core (cholesky_inverse, pinverse, diag, eye, etc — wouldn't compile); advanced_benchmarking.rs fabricates every benchmark number while importing-but-never-instantiating 6 real optimizers; second_order_new.rs is pure scaffolding with no Optimizer impl and an inner `pub mod lbfgs;` that doesn't resolve to any real path. All 4 confirmed outside the build graph already.
  - Files: the 4 files.
  - Tests: cargo check/cargo nextest run -p trustformers-optim --all-features (no-op diff).
  - Risk: none for the compiler. These existed as (non-compiling) design references for a future real AdaFisher/Shampoo/KFAC, recoverable via git history if ever wanted.
- [x] Re-export fsdp/optimizer_surgery/per_layer_quant at crate root (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal: FsdpConfig, OptimizerSurgeon, PerLayerQuantSelector, etc (21 types total) reachable at crate root.
  - Design: add 3 pub use blocks to lib.rs, alphabetized, mirroring the existing re-export style.
  - Files: trustformers-optim/src/lib.rs only.
  - Tests: cargo doc --no-deps; a smoke test importing all 3 from the crate root path.
  - Risk: none — zero naming collisions confirmed against the full existing public surface.
- [ ] Keep an eye on `convergence.rs` (1,964 lines) — closest file to the 2,000-line refactor threshold;
      consider splitting with `splitrs` if it grows further

---

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **Use trustformers-core abstractions only** (no external deps directly)
- **File size limit:** <2000 lines per file (currently satisfied crate-wide; see Housekeeping above)
- **Error handling:** `Result<T, TrustformersError>` from `trustformers-core`; **0 `.unwrap()`** in
  production or test source, verified today
- **Testing:** convergence tests required for new optimizers
- **Naming:** snake_case for all identifiers

### Adding a New Optimizer

**Checklist:**

1. **Implement the trait hierarchy** — the real `StatefulOptimizer` trait (`src/traits.rs`) uses
   associated types, not the simplified signature shown in earlier revisions of this document:
   ```rust
   pub trait StatefulOptimizer: Optimizer {
       type Config: Clone + Send + Sync;
       type State: Send + Sync;

       fn config(&self) -> &Self::Config;
       fn state(&self) -> &Self::State;
       fn state_mut(&mut self) -> &mut Self::State;
       fn state_dict(&self) -> Result<HashMap<String, Tensor>>;
       fn load_state_dict(&mut self, state: HashMap<String, Tensor>) -> Result<()>;
       fn memory_usage(&self) -> StateMemoryStats;
       fn reset_state(&mut self);
       fn num_parameters(&self) -> usize;
   }
   ```
   `step`/`zero_grad`/`update`/`get_lr`/`set_lr` come from the supertrait `Optimizer`
   (`trustformers_core::traits::Optimizer`), which every optimizer must also implement directly.

2. **Add state buffers** — momentum buffers, variance buffers, per-parameter state (`HashMap<String, Vec<f32>>`
   is the common pattern used throughout this crate)

3. **Implement the update rule** — follow the algorithm from the paper, handle edge cases (NaN/Inf,
   zero gradients)

4. **Add tests** — convergence test, state save/load round-trip, reference comparison

5. **Document** — algorithm, hyperparameter recommendations, use cases, a doctested example

### Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo nextest run -p trustformers-optim --all-features

# Test specific optimizer
cargo test -p trustformers-optim test_adam

# Benchmark

**2026-08-25 addendum (production-hardening honesty pass, `performance_validation.rs` +
`federated.rs` + `advanced_distributed_features.rs` only):** see the updated bullets above (Tooling ->
Performance validation harness; Federated & Continual Learning -> secure aggregation; Distributed &
Scaled Training -> Enhanced distributed trainer) for the fixes: `StatisticalAnalyzer::analyze`'s
`p_value` and `MathematicalProperty::SparsityHandling` (both no longer fabricated/aliased);
`SecureAggregation::generate_masks` (caller-supplied shapes, real pairwise-cancelling masks); `AutoScaler`
(a `NodeProvider` trait replaces silent fleet fabrication, mirroring
`elastic_training::WorkerProvisioner` in `trustformers-training`, AND the `ScalingEvent::reason` recorded
for a firing decision is now the real per-strategy trigger instead of a constant that was only ever
accurate for the `Performance` strategy -- found on a second pass over the same file after the first
fabrication was fixed but this second one was missed). Gates throughout this pass (re-run by the instance
that closed it out, after every edit including the `reason` fix): `cargo check -p trustformers-optim
--all-targets` and `cargo clippy -p trustformers-optim --all-targets -- -D warnings` both `EXIT=0`;
`cargo nextest run -p trustformers-optim --no-fail-fast` currently reports 1197 passed / 1 skipped / 0
failed. This pass added 20 new tests across the three files (verified via `git diff` against the commit
this branch started from): 5 in `federated.rs` for `SecureAggregation`; 8 in
`advanced_distributed_features/tests.rs` for `AutoScaler`/`NodeProvider` (6 for the fleet-fabrication fix,
2 proving the recorded `reason` names the strategy that actually fired -- `QueueBased`/`CostOptimized` --
rather than the old hardcoded `Performance`-strategy strings); and 7 in `performance_validation_tests.rs`
for `StatisticalAnalyzer::analyze`'s p-value fix (5, covering both the statistical behavior and the
`benchmark_optimizer`/`baseline_results` wiring) and `SparsityHandling` (2, added by the instance that
closed out this pass after confirming the real check landed with genuine logic but no dedicated
regression test of its own -- one proving it independently fails when convergence is real but no
zero-gradient step ever occurred, one proving it passes on the built-in "Sparse Gradient Handling" case's
real zero-gradient steps). Nothing else in either crate's `src/` was in scope for this pass and nothing
else was touched; `examples/comprehensive_distributed_training_benchmarks.rs` constructs `AutoScaler`
with no `NodeProvider` and is a known, deliberately-deferred follow-up (outside this package's ownership)
-- see the `AutoScaler` bullet above for the one-line fix it needs. Swept (this pass, both crates'
`examples/`/`benches/` dirs) for other callers of every changed signature
(`AutoScaler`/`update_and_scale`/`generate_masks`/`secure_aggregate`/`StatisticalAnalyzer::analyze`,
`create_checkpoint`/`execute_scaling`/`idle_cost_percentage`/`efficiency_score`) and for any workspace
crate depending on `trustformers-optim`/`trustformers-training` that references the touched public types
(`trustformers`, `trustformers-py`, `trustformers-c` all depend on both crates but none reference
`EfficiencyMetrics`/`CostTracker`/`ElasticTrainingCoordinator`/`SecureAggregation`/`AutoScaler`/
`StatisticalMetrics` anywhere in their own `src/`/`examples/`) -- the one example above is the only
runtime-behavior consequence found.
