## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues Across Projects

#### Model Loading Failures
```
Error: Failed to load model from URL
Solution: Check internet connectivity, verify model name
```

#### Memory Issues
```
Error: Out of memory during inference
Solution: Reduce batch size, use INT8 quantization
```

#### Performance Issues
```
Problem: Slow inference on device
Solution: Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
```

#### Build Errors
```
Error: Missing TrustformeRS dependency
Solution: Verify package manager setup and sync
```

### Platform-Specific Issues
