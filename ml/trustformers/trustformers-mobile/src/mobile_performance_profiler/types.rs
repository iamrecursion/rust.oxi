//! Mobile Performance Profiler Types
//!
//! This module contains all the core types, configuration structures, metrics definitions,
//! and enums used throughout the mobile performance profiler system. It provides a comprehensive
//! foundation for mobile ML inference performance monitoring, debugging, and optimization.
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! The types are organized into several logical groups:
//!
//! - **Configuration Types**: All configuration structures for profiler setup
//! - **Profiling Enums**: Core enums for modes, types, and classifications
//! - **Metrics Types**: All metrics data structures for performance measurement
//! - **Core Data Types**: Main operational data structures
//! - **Platform-specific Types**: iOS and Android specific structures
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use trustformers_mobile::mobile_performance_profiler::types::*;
//! use trustformers_mobile::mobile_performance_profiler::MobileProfilerConfig;
//!
//! // Create a profiler configuration
//! let config = MobileProfilerConfig::default();
//!
//! // Create a metrics snapshot
//! let snapshot = MobileMetricsSnapshot::default();
//! # let _ = (config, snapshot);
//! ```
