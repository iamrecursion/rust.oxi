//! Distributed data-parallel training primitives.
//!
//! # Backends
//!
//! Two collective backends are implemented in pure Rust and perform **real**
//! data movement and reduction arithmetic:
//!
//! * [`DistributedBackend::InProcess`] — multiple ranks running as threads of a
//!   single process, rendezvousing through shared memory. This is the backend
//!   exercised by the test-suite and by single-machine simulations.
//! * [`DistributedBackend::Tcp`] — multiple ranks running as separate processes
//!   (optionally on separate hosts), communicating over TCP sockets.
//!
//! Both are built on the transport/collective layer in
//! [`trustformers_core::parallel::collective`], which implements ring all-reduce,
//! ring all-gather, ring reduce-scatter, binomial broadcast/reduce and a
//! rendezvous barrier.
//!
//! [`DistributedBackend::NCCL`], [`DistributedBackend::Gloo`] and
//! [`DistributedBackend::MPI`] wrap C/C++/CUDA libraries which the project's
//! pure-Rust policy forbids from the default build. They are retained as enum
//! variants so that configuration files remain loadable, but every constructor
//! and every collective returns [`DistributedError::BackendUnavailable`]. They
//! never fabricate a result.
