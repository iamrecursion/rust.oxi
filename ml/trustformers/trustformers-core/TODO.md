# trustformers-core TODO List

## Overview

The `trustformers-core` crate is the foundational infrastructure of the TrustformeRS ecosystem.
It provides core tensor operations, hardware acceleration, layer abstractions, and all fundamental
building blocks required by model implementations in trustformers-models and other crates.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Multi-backend tensor abstraction — CPU (real), CUDA (real, hardware-verified), Metal (real, hardware-verified); ROCm/Vulkan feature-gated and experimental (real scaffolding, not hardware-verified here); XLA/oneAPI/RISC-V present as honest no-op facades (structured errors / scalar fallback, no real backend linked); TPU not implemented at all (see "Hardware Acceleration" below for specifics, corrected 2026-08-24)
- Hardware acceleration infrastructure
- Core layers (Linear, Embedding, LayerNorm, Attention, FFN)
- Memory management and optimization
- AutoDiff engine for backpropagation
- Quantization infrastructure
- Weight loading and checkpoint conversion
- Export formats (ONNX, GGUF, TensorRT, Core ML, TVM)
- Error handling and debugging tools

#### ROCm/HIP Backend (AMD GPUs)
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — the checklist below (originally all ✅) overclaimed against the real source. Verified against `src/gpu_ops/rocm.rs`, `src/kernels/rocm_impl.rs`, `src/kernels/rocm_kernels.rs`, and the `rocm = ["dep:libloading"]` feature in `Cargo.toml`: the `rocm` feature depends only on `libloading` — no `hip-sys`/rocBLAS crate. `rocm_impl.rs`'s own doc comment describes itself as providing "actual ROCm/HIP runtime API bindings to replace the simulated implementations in `rocm_kernels.rs`" — it `dlopen`s `libamdhip64.so`/`.so.5`/`.so.6` at runtime and calls the real HIP C ABI through raw function pointers **if** that library and an AMD GPU are present on the host. This has not been run against real ROCm/AMD-GPU hardware in this environment (none available) and is not covered by the workspace's default-feature test baseline. Whether `rocm_kernels.rs`'s older simulated path is still reachable from any call site, or fully superseded by `rocm_impl.rs`, was not traced this pass. Treat as experimental and hardware-unverified, not "full ROCm/HIP integration."

#### Metal Backend (Apple Silicon)
- ✅ **Real, hardware-verified on this machine** (Apple Silicon): device-resident matmul, GELU, LayerNorm, and attention run via `oxicuda-metal` (Pure Rust), **not** the Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) framework this section previously described — the `scirs2-core` MPS dependency was dropped. See root `README.md`'s CUDA/Metal runtime-verification note and `trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/metal/` for the current implementation. `Tensor::Metal` now stores a refcounted `MetalBufferHandle` (RAII; added 2026-08-24) instead of a bare `BufferId`; `trustformers-models`'s own call sites (`gpt2/model/{model_blocks,model_core,model_ops}.rs`) were converted to match during Wave 5 — see the Housekeeping note below, corrected 2026-08-25.
- Custom Metal compute kernels exist and are exercised by the tests above; "MSL kernels" / "tile-based rendering utilization" language in the previous version of this list described GPU-rendering concepts not applicable to this crate's compute-only use and has been removed rather than kept as decoration.

#### Intel oneAPI Backend
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — every ✅ below was fabricated. Verified: `oneapi = []` in `Cargo.toml` (zero dependencies — no SYCL/DPC++/oneDNN/oneMKL crate of any kind). `src/kernels/oneapi_impl.rs` declares `extern "C"` bindings to a SYCL/oneDNN/oneMKL runtime that nothing links; every public method (`compile_kernel`, `execute_kernel`, convolution, GEMM, USM allocation, ...) returns a structured error naming exactly what isn't linked (e.g. `"Intel oneAPI backend is not available: no SYCL/oneDNN/oneMKL runtime is linked"`) rather than a fabricated result — so the code itself never lies, even though this checklist did. No DPC++/SYCL compilation, no oneDNN, no oneMKL, no FPGA support exist in this crate today.

#### Google XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — every ✅ below was fabricated. Verified: `xla = []` in `Cargo.toml` (zero dependencies). `src/kernels/xla_impl.rs` declares `extern "C"` bindings to an XLA runtime that nothing links; every public method returns a structured "no XLA runtime is linked" error rather than a fabricated result. No HLO compilation, shape inference, operation fusion, or multi-platform (CPU/GPU/TPU) code generation exist in this crate today.

#### TPU Backend (Google Cloud TPU)
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — every ✅ below was fabricated, and there isn't even an empty `tpu` feature flag in `Cargo.toml` (checked: none exists) or a TPU-specific module under `src/`. Root `README.md` states this plainly: "TPU is a placeholder, not implemented." The hardware-spec figures below (teraflops/HBM per generation) were never backed by any code in this crate and are deleted rather than kept as reference numbers for a feature that doesn't exist.

#### RISC-V Vector Extensions (RVV)
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — every ✅ below was fabricated. Verified: `riscv = []` in `Cargo.toml` (zero dependencies). `src/kernels/riscv_impl.rs`'s own module doc comment is honest about this (unlike the oneAPI/XLA files above, which needed a doc-comment fix too — see root `TODO.md` P1): it models RVV register allocation and can emit `vsetvli`/`vle`/`vse`/... assembly text for inspection, but nothing here executes real RVV instructions (no `core::arch::asm!` anywhere in the module) — actual results always come from a scalar-CPU fallback (`RiscVBackend::simulate_vector_execution`) that computes correct results using ordinary Rust arithmetic, not RVV-accelerated. No RVV 1.0 hardware compliance, VLEN adaptation, or LMUL register grouping exist as real, hardware-executed behavior.

#### Vulkan Compute
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — this checklist overclaimed. Verified: `vulkan = ["dep:vulkano", "dep:vulkano-shaders", "dep:bytemuck"]` in `Cargo.toml` — real Vulkan compute crates, unlike ROCm/oneAPI/XLA above. `src/kernels/vulkan_impl.rs` does real, `#[cfg(feature = "vulkan")]`-gated `vulkano` device/instance/pipeline/descriptor-set setup (imports the real API, not a facade) — but several of its actual compute operations return a structured `TrustformersError::not_implemented` rather than a computed result (verified by reading the file: multiple sites, plus one `// For now, return placeholder values` comment and a `_placeholder: ()` struct field). So: real GPU-setup scaffolding, incomplete compute coverage. Not hardware-tested in this environment (no Vulkan-capable discrete GPU exercised this pass). Cross-platform vendor/OS coverage claims below were not independently verified and are removed rather than repeated.

#### Flash Attention
> **Corrected 2026-08-24** — the previous "All Backends" framing implied CUDA/ROCm/Metal/Vulkan all ship a working flash-attention kernel. Verified real and tested: **CUDA** (custom fused kernels, part of the `oxicuda` resident-attention chain documented in the "0.2.0 Release Scope" section below) and **Metal** (via `oxicuda-metal`, see above — not MPS graph operations, that framework is no longer used). **ROCm** and **Vulkan** flash attention are not confirmed real given the backend-level findings above (ROCm: hardware/runtime-dependent dlopen path, not independently checked for a flash-attention-specific kernel; Vulkan: several compute paths return `not_implemented`) — do not assume either has a working flash-attention kernel without checking the current source directly.

## Known Limitations

### Hardware Backend Limitations
- **Metal Flash Attention:** Requires macOS 10.15+ or iOS 13+; runs on `oxicuda-metal`, not MPS (see "Metal Backend" above)
- **TPU Backend:** Not implemented — there is no `tpu` feature flag and no TPU-specific module in this crate (corrected 2026-08-24; the previous wording, "requires Google Cloud TPU access and authentication," wrongly implied a real backend gated only on credentials)
- **XLA / Intel oneAPI Backends:** `xla`/`oneapi` features exist but pull zero dependencies; every operation returns a structured "no runtime linked" error (see "Google XLA" / "Intel oneAPI Backend" above)
- **RISC-V RVV Backend:** `riscv` feature runs a scalar-CPU simulation, not real RVV instructions (see "RISC-V Vector Extensions" above)
- **ROCm / Vulkan Backends:** feature-gated and experimental; not hardware-verified in this environment (see their sections above)
- **Some Features:** Platform-specific driver/SDK requirements

### Numerical Precision
- **Floating-Point:** Adaptive tolerance system for numerical stability tests
- **Platform Variations:** Some operations may have minor precision differences across backends
- **Half Precision:** F16/BF16 have reduced precision (acceptable for most ML tasks)

### Performance
- **CPU Fallback:** Some operations fall back to CPU when not implemented on specific backend
- **Small Tensors:** Overhead may dominate for very small tensors on GPU

### Housekeeping
- ~~**Stray Backup Files:** 6 `.bak2` files remain under `src/`~~ — **resolved, verified 2026-08-24**: zero `.bak2` files found under `src/` today.
- ~~**Orphaned Module:** `src/quantization/int2.rs` ... never declared in `quantization/mod.rs`~~ — **resolved, verified 2026-08-24**: `quantization/mod.rs` now has `pub mod int2;`; the module is reachable and part of the compiled public API. (The "INT2 and sub-byte quantization" checkbox under Future Enhancements below was not re-verified against this — check before ticking it.)
- ~~**File Size Policy:** `gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs` grew to 2,187 lines~~ — **resolved, verified 2026-08-24**: the file is 1,474 lines today, under the 2,000-line policy limit (functionality was carved out into `attention.rs`/`batched.rs`, both already tracked above).
- ~~**New, 2026-08-24**: `gpu_ops/metal/types.rs` gained a real RAII `MetalBufferHandle`... `trustformers-models/src/gpt2/model/{model_blocks.rs,model_core.rs,model_ops.rs}` has not been converted to match: `cargo check -p trustformers-models --features metal,gpt2` fails with 15 compiler errors today (5 `MetalTensorData{buffer_id:...}` construction-literal sites, 10 bare `.buffer_id` field reads)~~ — **resolved, corrected 2026-08-25**: the conversion was completed during Wave 5 (`models-hard` package). Re-verified today via the most recent available gate evidence (Wave 6c's own verification pass): `cargo check`/`cargo nextest run -p trustformers-models --features metal,gpt2` compiles with zero `error[E...]` hits and runs 1,897 tests (1,895 passed; the 2 failures are unrelated environmental proptest wall-clock timeouts in `models_property_tests`, not a compile error). Root `TODO.md`'s P0 section, which used to carry the same "15 compiler errors" claim as its #2 entry, is corrected in this same pass.

## 0.2.0 Release Scope (added 2026-07-06)

Two tracks for the 0.2.0 release: (1) **OxiCUDA GPU migration** — finish moving GPU semantics off `scirs2-core` (whose `PlatformCapabilities.cuda_available` is hardcoded false in 0.6.0) onto the oxicuda 0.4.x backend already integrated behind the `cuda`/`metal` features; (2) **PyTorch (tch) dependency removal** — delete the `tch` dependency and the `torch` feature entirely in 0.2.0 (workspace Cargo.toml:82, trustformers-core `torch` feature + ~40 lines of cfg arms, and the forwarder features in trustformers, trustformers-training, trustformers-c). `Tensor::Torch` is never constructed anywhere in the workspace and the cfg(torch) "PyTorch validation" is simulated with hardcoded results, so zero functionality is lost, while tch costs a multi-GB libtorch download plus Pure-Rust policy violations (torch-sys pulls cc/C++, the OxiARC-banned zip 0.6.6, ureq, and duplicate old ndarray/rand/safetensors pins). All real PyTorch interop (safetensors, checkpoint/formats.rs, utils/weight_loading.rs) is pure Rust already and stays. Do NOT adopt ToRSh as a replacement now — crates.io torsh 0.1.3 pins scirs2 0.5.1 (type-incompatible with our scirs2 0.6.0 stack) and torsh 0.2.0 is unpublished; a P2 task below records evaluating an optional `torsh-interop` feature in 0.3.x once torsh 0.2.0 ships. Sub-decision on candle: drop the unused candle-nn workspace dep now, keep the `candle` feature/variant through 0.2.0 (it is in every `full` set), and decide implement-vs-remove in 0.3.x.

### Track 1: OxiCUDA GPU migration (scirs2-core gpu → OxiCUDA)

- [x] **[P0] Replace scirs2 PlatformCapabilities GPU detection in device.rs with oxicuda-native probes** — DONE (2026-07-06)
  - `Device::cuda_if_available()` now calls `crate::gpu_ops::cuda::oxicuda_cuda_available()`; `Device::best_available()` checks CUDA via that probe first, then `metal::Device::system_default().is_some()`, then falls back to CPU. Ordering is CUDA > Metal > CPU. Doc comments updated to explain why PlatformCapabilities is unsuitable for GPU detection. Added 3 new unit tests (`test_cuda_if_available_does_not_panic`, `test_metal_if_available_does_not_panic`, `test_best_available_does_not_panic`) asserting a valid `Device` is always returned. `hardware/devices.rs` and `hardware/manager.rs` do not use `PlatformCapabilities` at all, so no changes were needed there (though `hardware/manager.rs` has its own pre-existing, unrelated `is_cuda_available`/`is_metal_available`/`is_rocm_available` hardcoded-`true` placeholder bug, noted but out of scope). Additionally, the upstream scirs2-core `PlatformCapabilities` GPU-misreporting bug itself was fixed in the ~/work/scirs repo (0.6.1 branch, real CUDA runtime probe via `simd_ops/gpu_detection.rs`; no commit/publish here). Workspace-wide `cargo check --all-features` and `cargo clippy --all-features --all-targets` both verified clean in this round's convergence pass; full nextest suite 12033/12033 passed.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/device.rs:79-113; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs:1193-1200; trustformers-core/src/tensor/math_ops/linear_algebra.rs:202-204; trustformers-core/tests/test_device_linear.rs:45

- [x] **[P1] Fix the CUDA resident-buffer lifecycle: device memory leaks until clear_buffer_cache()** — DONE (2026-07-06)
  - Implemented an `Arc`-based RAII `OxiCudaBufferHandle` (re-exported as `gpu_ops::cuda::BufferHandle`); last-clone drop removes the `DeviceBuffer` from the backend cache via a best-effort release callback (no panic, no lock-order inversion; monotonic never-reused ids make it double-free-proof). `CudaTensorData` now holds the handle, so all resident op outputs (matmul, linear, layernorm, GELU, uploads) free on last tensor drop, including error paths; Linear's CUDA weight cache also stores a handle. Added 6 hardware-free refcount unit tests (mocked release fn). `cargo nextest -p trustformers-core --features cuda -E 'test(/cuda|buffer|resident/)'` = 20/20 passed at implementation time; `cargo check`/`clippy --all-targets` clean on cuda and default features. Re-verified clean in this round's workspace-wide convergence pass.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/tensor/mod.rs:185-201; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs:63-73,294,405,468,552

- [x] **[P1] Build the CUDA-resident attention chain (CUDA-7) on OxicudaCudaBackend** — DONE (2026-07-06)
  - New module `gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/attention.rs` implements the resident method set (gather_heads, gather_heads_transposed, rope_neox, softmax_causal/rows, add, attention_prefill, attention_decode, concat_kt_cache/concat_v_cache), all bracketed with `cuCtxSynchronize` for cross-stream ordering and feeding the refcounted buffer-handle lifecycle. `Tensor::add` got a resident CUDA×CUDA same-device/shape/F32 arm so residuals stay on-device. Wired into GPT-NeoX (`cuda_resident_forward`, prefill-only — the NeoX `Layer` trait has no KV-cache plumbing) and GPT-2 (`cuda_resident_attention` in `forward_with_cache`, covering empty-cache bulk prefill and per-token decode against a resident cache; batch>1 or non-F32 declines to the existing host-download path). Documented upstream oxicuda 0.4.0 defects that shaped the design (GEMM ignores transpose flags/no lda; `mha::multi_head_attention` has an OOB/aliasing bug; causal_softmax masks by global row index). 10 hardware-free plan tests run everywhere; 7 availability-gated GPU parity tests skip cleanly without a GPU. Verification at implementation time: clippy clean on core+models (cuda/default); nextest core cuda attention/rope/softmax/resident 163/163, wider gemm/buffer/cuda/gather/concat 205/205, trustformers-models full suite w/ cuda 1089/1089. Real-hardware execution not possible on this macOS host; correctness rests on source-verified kernel signatures and CPU-parity tests. GPT-2 batch>1/non-F32 and multi-token-continuation-behind-cache still use fallback paths (documented, not half-wired). Re-verified clean in this round's workspace-wide convergence pass (12033/12033 tests, 113 GPU tests skipped by design on this non-CUDA host).
  - Evidence: TODO-CUDA.md:18-25; trustformers-core/src/tensor/math_ops/arithmetic.rs:146-157; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs:294-1140; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/attention.rs; trustformers-models/src/gpt_neox/model.rs:164-180; trustformers-models/src/gpt2/model/model_blocks.rs
  - Update (2026-07-07): the three 0.4.0 defects documented here (GEMM transpose/lda, mha OOB/no-op, causal_softmax global-row masking) are fixed upstream in the published oxicuda 0.4.1; the transpose-driven workarounds (K^T materialisation, K^T cache layout) were removed — see the "Bump oxicuda pins" entry below for the full resolution record.

- [x] **[P1] Route Tensor::CUDA operands through Tensor::matmul and add strided-batched GEMM** — DONE (2026-07-06, with a deviation from the planned approach)
  - Added a resident match arm routing any `Tensor::CUDA` operand to a new `dispatch_oxicuda_matmul_resident`, and extended the host-offload arm from 2D-only to any rank ≥2 with NumPy-style broadcasting (new `BatchedMatmulPlan` shape planner in `gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/batched.rs`). DEVIATION: the plan's suggested `oxicuda-blas::gemm_strided_batched` was verified (by reading the published oxicuda-blas 0.4.0 / oxicuda-ptx 0.4.0 sources) to be broken upstream — the batched entry points build an 8-parameter GEMM kernel template but launch it with a differently-ordered 13/17-element tuple, corrupting dimensions into pointer slots. Implemented instead as a per-batch loop over the already-validated single-GEMM entry point (still fully device-resident, one async launch per batch on one stream), with the upstream defect documented in the module for a future single-launch upgrade once oxicuda fixes it. 11 hardware-free plan tests run everywhere; 6 availability-gated GPU parity tests skip cleanly without a GPU. Verification at implementation time: clippy clean; nextest matmul/gemm 33/33, cuda/buffer/resident 37/37. Re-verified clean in this round's workspace-wide convergence pass.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/tensor/math_ops/linear_algebra.rs:197-211,566-570; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs:294; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/batched.rs
  - Update (2026-07-07): the upstream launch-tuple corruption in `gemm_strided_batched` is fixed in the published oxicuda 0.4.1 (honest validation + matched launch tuple). The per-batch loop here is deliberately retained: `BatchedMatmulPlan`'s non-uniform broadcast offsets cannot be expressed as one stride, and 0.4.1's strided path is itself a per-batch launch loop, so switching would save nothing. Module docs updated; see the "Bump oxicuda pins" entry below.

- [x] **[P1] Thread the CUDA device id through CudaTensorData (device 0 is hardcoded)** — DONE (2026-07-06)
  - Landed together with the buffer-lifecycle fix above: `OxiCudaBufferHandle`/`CudaTensorData` now carry the device ordinal (`device_id()`). Download (utils.rs, was `get_cuda_backend(0)`), GELU (activations.rs, was `device_id=0` TODO), layernorm, and linear forward all now use the tensor's actual device; cross-device operand mismatches fall back to host, and CUDA→CUDA to a different ordinal bounces through host (matching the `to_device_enum` policy). `OxicudaCudaBackend::new` validates the ordinal against `oxicuda_driver::Device::count()`. Host matmul dispatch uses a `default_cuda_device_id()` (0, overridable via `TRUSTFORMERS_CUDA_DEVICE`) rather than a hardcoded literal. No dedicated multi-GPU hardware test was run (no multi-GPU hardware available in this environment); correctness verified via the mocked-release refcount unit tests and code-path review.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/tensor/math_ops/linear_algebra.rs:203; trustformers-core/src/tensor/utils.rs:466-563; trustformers-core/src/tensor/mod.rs:185-189; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs:1227

- [x] **[P1] Bump oxicuda pins 0.4.0 -> 0.4.1 once oxicuda 0.4.1 is published on crates.io** — DONE (2026-07-07)
  - oxicuda 0.4.1 is now published on crates.io (commit `facb2cd` "Availability of 0.4.1"). Cargo.toml pins were already at 0.4.1; this session updated Cargo.lock (all eight oxicuda crates 0.4.0 -> 0.4.1). The earlier "delta is API-identical" note was superseded by the published release: `oxicuda_blas::reduction::causal_softmax` gained an explicit `seq_len` parameter (masking by `row % seq_len`), and the three trustformers call sites were adapted.
  - **Upstream bug resolutions verified against the published 0.4.1 sources (2026-07-07)** — all three originally-reported 0.4.0 bugs plus the separately-found causal-softmax batch bug are fixed upstream:
    1. Batched GEMM launch-tuple corruption: `gemm_strided_batched` now validates arguments, honestly rejects unsupported transpose/ld combinations, and launches a correctly matched tuple. trustformers keeps its per-batch `gemm` loop anyway — `BatchedMatmulPlan`'s non-uniform broadcast offsets cannot be expressed as a single stride, and the upstream strided path is itself a sequential per-batch launch loop (module docs updated in `gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/batched.rs`).
    2. GEMM transpose flags/leading dimensions: transposed operands now dispatch to a SIMT kernel honouring all four `(trans_a, trans_b)` combinations; non-tightly-packed / column-major operands are honestly rejected. Workarounds REMOVED: `gather_heads_transposed_gpu_to_gpu` + `gather_heads_transposed_plan` (pitched-copy `K^T` materialisation) and `concat_kt_cache_gpu_to_gpu` + `concat_kt_plan` (column-oriented `K^T` cache append) are deleted; `attention_prefill_gpu_to_gpu` / `attention_decode_gpu_to_gpu` now take heads-major `[H, kv, d]` keys and apply `Transpose::Trans` on the score GEMM; GPT-2/GPT-NeoX resident paths updated (GPT-2's resident KV cache now stores K in the same `[1, H, kv, d]` layout as V and appends via `concat_v_cache_gpu_to_gpu`).
    3. `mha::multi_head_attention` no-op stub/OOB: 0.4.1 ships real QK^T/softmax/PV kernels with a dedicated score scratch. trustformers still composes its own chain (upstream mha has no KV-cache/decode surface and takes an additive mask tensor); module docs updated and a TODO recorded in `gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/attention.rs`.
    4. `causal_softmax` global-row masking: fixed via the new `seq_len` parameter (`row % seq_len` boundary reset, upstream regression-tested for `[batch*heads*seq, seq]`). trustformers' per-head invocation in `attention_prefill_gpu_to_gpu` is retained as a `[seq, seq]` scratch-reuse choice, no longer a correctness constraint.
  - **Still open upstream (f64 only)**: `oxicuda-dnn`'s `generate_scale_mask_ptx` (the scale+mask step inside `multi_head_attention`) is hardcoded to f32 addressing (`f32_elem_addr`/`load_global_f32`), so the f64 instantiation mis-addresses 8-byte elements. trustformers is unaffected today (the resident CUDA path is `DeviceBuffer<f32>`-only), but any future f64/dtype-polymorphic resident work (see the P2 f16/bf16 task below) must not route f64 attention through upstream `multi_head_attention` until this is fixed.
  - Verification (2026-07-07, macOS host — no CUDA hardware, so GPU parity tests self-skip): `cargo check -p trustformers-core --features cuda` clean; `cargo clippy -p trustformers-core --features cuda --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; `cargo clippy -p trustformers-models --features cuda --all-targets -- -D warnings` clean; nextest trustformers-core w/ cuda 2343/2343 passed (2 skipped), trustformers-models w/ cuda 1089/1089 passed (28 skipped). On-device parity for the new `Transpose::Trans` score GEMMs and the 6-arg `causal_softmax` rests on the existing availability-gated GPU tests — rerun them on real CUDA hardware before a release that exercises this backend.

### Track 2: PyTorch (tch) dependency removal

- [x] **[P0] Delete the Tensor::Torch variant, the torch feature, and every cfg(feature="torch") arm** — DONE (2026-07-06)
  - Fully removed as planned: the optional `tch` dep and `torch` feature (+ `full` comment) from trustformers-core/Cargo.toml (and the forwarder features in trustformers, trustformers-training, trustformers-c, and the root workspace tch dep, plus the `.typos.toml` `tch` dictionary entry). Deleted `Tensor::Torch` variant, its Clone/Debug arms, narrowed `unsafe impl Sync for Tensor` to `#[cfg(feature = "candle")]`; removed the six torch accessor arms in tensor/utils.rs, the memory/mod.rs arm, and the error-only arms in quantization/ggml_advanced.rs and smoothquant.rs. `testing/cross_framework.rs`'s `check_pytorch_available()` now unconditionally returns false and `validate_pytorch()` collapses to the not-available branch. All pure-Rust PyTorch format compat (checkpoint/*, utils/weight_loading.rs PyTorchReader, optim pytorch_compat.rs, tokenizers pytorch.rs, hub.rs) was left untouched as required. Verification (workspace-wide convergence): `rg '\btch\b|feature = "torch"|"torch"'` across sources returns only harmless residue (commented-out example prose, an unrelated wasm string literal, and the intentionally-kept `data_str.contains("torch")` PyTorch-format-detection heuristic in weight_loading.rs); `rg '"tch"|torch-sys' Cargo.lock` is empty; `cargo check`/`clippy --all-features --all-targets` clean; full nextest suite 12033/12033 passed.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/Cargo.toml:65,108-110,132; trustformers-core/src/tensor/mod.rs:220-221,246-247,272-273,297-298; trustformers-core/src/tensor/utils.rs:108-109,136-137,182-183,871-872,908-909,936-937; trustformers-core/src/memory/mod.rs:437-438; trustformers-core/src/quantization/ggml_advanced.rs:191-192,322-323,432-433; trustformers-core/src/quantization/smoothquant.rs:227-234,397-403,623-628,705-710,931-933; trustformers-core/src/testing/cross_framework.rs:241,309-325

### Post-0.2.0 (0.3.x) — record-only follow-ups

- [ ] **[P2] f16/bf16 device-resident compute via a dtype-polymorphic buffer cache** (oxicuda)
  - The backend buffer cache is monomorphized to `DeviceBuffer<f32>`, and F16/BF16 matmul upcasts to f32 on the CPU. oxicuda-blas GEMM is generic over f16/bf16/FP8 via `GpuFloat` (~/work/oxicuda crates/oxicuda-blas/src/types.rs:184-360); making the cache dtype-polymorphic unlocks half-precision GEMM on device. Explicitly deferred from 0.2.0 by the OxiCUDA readiness assessment.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/cuda/oxicuda/mod.rs:66-73; trustformers-core/src/tensor/math_ops/linear_algebra.rs:504-566

- [ ] **[P2] Re-enable or delete gpu_accelerated / hardware_acceleration under the cuda feature (CUDA-3)** (oxicuda)
  - Both modules are compiled `#[cfg(not(feature = "cuda"))]` because they call the removed cudarc kernel API; kernels/mod.rs no longer contains cuda modules. Either port their kernel calls to the oxicuda backend or delete the modules if the resident-op set makes them redundant. Tracked in-repo as TODO-CUDA.md CUDA-3.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/lib.rs:81-95; trustformers-core/src/gpu_accelerated.rs:5-6; TODO-CUDA.md:18-25

- [ ] **[P2] GPU quantized inference (quantization modules reject Tensor::CUDA)** (oxicuda)
  - Quantization paths reject CUDA tensors outright. oxicuda provides AWQ / INT8 / INT4 / FP8 quantization kernels (oxicuda-dnn quantization + oxicuda-quant/-infer upstream) to back a device-resident quantized matmul path.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/quantization/ggml_advanced.rs:201,332,442; trustformers-core/src/quantization/smoothquant.rs:223,421,620,702

- [ ] **[P2] Fused transformer-layer megakernel (CUDA-6) and GPU training via oxicuda-train** (oxicuda)
  - Both already scoped out of 0.2.0. CUDA-6 (fused megakernel) is perf-only and tracked in TODO-CUDA.md. GPU training would exploit oxicuda-train's AMP (FP16/BF16 + loss scaling), fused Adam/AdamW/SGD/LAMB, grad accumulation/clipping, ZeRO, and checkpointing — none of which trustformers uses today; 0.2.0 is inference-focused.
  - Evidence: TODO-CUDA.md:18-25; external: ~/work/oxicuda crates/oxicuda-train/src

- [ ] **[P2] Hold wgpu/WebGPU consolidation onto oxicuda-webgpu until wgpu majors align** (oxicuda)
  - Keep trustformers-core's own wgpu 30.0-based backend (src/gpu_ops/webgpu.rs, workspace pin at Cargo.toml:271) and trustformers-wasm's web-sys-based browser WebGPU as-is. oxicuda-webgpu pins wgpu 29.0.3, so adopting it now would drag a second wgpu major into the tree or force a downgrade of a working 1,230-line backend; the wasm path uses web-sys, not the wgpu crate, and gains nothing. Revisit only after oxicuda bumps to wgpu 30.x, and then only for the native `wgpu_backend` feature.
  - Evidence: Cargo.toml:271; trustformers-core/src/gpu_ops/webgpu.rs:26,89-130; trustformers-wasm/src/compute/webgpu/backend.rs:79,95; external: ~/work/oxicuda Cargo.toml:71

- [ ] **[P2] Evaluate an optional torsh-interop feature once torsh 0.2.0 ships on crates.io** (tch)
  - Do not adopt ToRSh in 0.2.0: crates.io torsh 0.1.3 pins scirs2 0.5.1 (type-incompatible duplicate of trustformers' scirs2 0.6.0 stack), torsh 0.2.0 is unpublished with a workspace-blocking compile error, and torsh adds no missing capability (no real pickle .pt parser either). Revisit as an optional `torsh-interop` feature in 0.3.x once torsh 0.2.0 is on crates.io with a compatible scirs2 stack (~/work/torsh).
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/Cargo.toml:65 (removed tch slot); external: ~/work/torsh

- [ ] **[P2] Decide the candle backend's fate (implement or remove)** (tch)
  - `Tensor::Candle` is in the identical vestigial state as the removed torch variant — never constructed, referenced only in read-only/error match arms — and candle-nn is being dropped from the workspace as unused. It is kept through 0.2.0 because the `candle` feature is part of `full` (Cargo.toml:133). In 0.3.x either implement a real candle backend or delete the variant + feature, which would also allow removing the (by then candle-only) `unsafe impl Sync for Tensor` at src/tensor/mod.rs:297-298 entirely.
  - Evidence: trustformers-core/src/tensor/mod.rs:222-223,297-298; trustformers-core/Cargo.toml:133; Cargo.toml:80-81

## Development Guidelines

### General Policies
See main project TODO.md and SCIRS2_INTEGRATION_POLICY.md for comprehensive development policies.

### Core-Specific Guidelines

#### Dependency Rules (CRITICAL)
- ✅ **External Dependencies:** Only trustformers-core can use external crates directly
- ✅ **Re-exports:** Core must re-export all needed functionality for other crates
- ✅ **SciRS2 Integration:** Use scirs2-core for scientific computing (SIMD, random, ndarray)
- ❌ **Application Crates:** Must NEVER import external deps (use core abstractions only)

#### Code Standards
- **Naming:** snake_case for all identifiers
- **File Size:** Maximum 2000 lines (use splitrs for refactoring)
- **Error Handling:** Always use `Result<T, TrustformersError>`
- **Testing:** Use `std::env::temp_dir()` for temporary files
- **Documentation:** rustdoc with examples for all public APIs
- **No Warnings:** Must pass `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all public APIs
- Property-based tests for tensor operations
- Numerical stability tests with adaptive tolerance
- Cross-backend compatibility tests
- Memory leak detection tests
- Performance benchmarks
