Core infrastructure crate providing fundamental abstractions and utilities for the TrustformeRS ecosystem.

## Current State

**Version 0.2.1 — last verified 2026-08-24**

This crate is **stable and production-ready** for its real (CPU/CUDA/Metal) compute paths, serving as the foundation for all other TrustformeRS components. It provides high-performance tensor operations, layer implementations, and advanced optimization techniques. The last workspace-level test run reported to this documentation pass measured 21,370 passed / 41 skipped / 0 failed across the whole workspace (default features, 2026-08-26) — this crate's own share was not re-measured separately this pass; see `TODO.md` for the crate's detailed, dated status (including which GPU backends are real vs. feature-flag facades).

## Features

### Tensor Operations
- **Comprehensive tensor abstraction** supporting multiple backends
- **SciRS2 integration** for SIMD-optimized operations
- **GPU support**: each backend below is an opt-in Cargo feature (no GPU backend is enabled by default, `default = ["linalg"]`), but the features are not equally real. **Real, hardware-verified on this project's own machines**: CUDA (`cuda`, via the Pure-Rust `oxicuda`), Metal (`metal`, via `oxicuda-metal`). **Real code, not hardware-verified in this environment**: Vulkan (`vulkan`, via `vulkano` — device/pipeline setup is real, several compute operations still return a structured "not implemented" error), ROCm (`rocm` — real `dlopen`-based HIP calls if a real AMD runtime is present on the host). **Empty facades — the feature exists, the backend does not**: `oneapi`, `xla`, `riscv` (every operation returns a structured "no runtime linked" error or runs a scalar-CPU fallback; see `TODO.md` for specifics). `wgpu_backend`/`opencl` exist as features but were not characterized by this documentation pass.
- **Automatic differentiation** with reverse-mode and forward-mode autodiff
- **Memory-efficient operations** with zero-copy views

### Layer Implementations
- **Core Layers**: Linear, Embedding, LayerNorm, Dropout, RMSNorm
- **Attention Mechanisms**:
  - Multi-head attention (MHA) with causal masking
  - FlashAttention and FlashAttention-2 for memory efficiency
  - Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)
  - PagedAttention for KV cache management
  - Optimized SDPA kernels with adaptive strategies
- **Advanced Layers**: FeedForward (SwiGLU, GeGLU), PositionalEncoding, RoPE, ALiBi

### Performance Optimizations
- **SIMD Operations**: Optimized LayerNorm, Softmax, and RoPE implementations
- **Quantization Support**: INT8, INT4, FP16, FP8, GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF/K-quants with calibration
- **Custom Kernels**: Fused operations for reduced memory bandwidth
- **Kernel Tuning**: Automatic hardware-aware kernel parameter optimization
- **Memory Management**: Adaptive pooling with LRU, LFU, ARC, and Hybrid eviction policies
- **Conv2D**: Full im2col+matmul implementation with groups and dilation
- **GPU Attention**: Scaled dot-product and flash attention (tiled online-softmax); the CUDA backend (`cuda` feature) additionally runs a fully GPU-resident attention pipeline — QKV split, RoPE, causal softmax, KV-cache append — and batched/broadcasting matmul, avoiding host round-trips during prefill and decode

### Export and Interoperability
- **ONNX Export**: Complete graph construction and runtime support
- **GGML/GGUF**: Advanced quantization formats including K-quants for edge deployment
- **CoreML**: iOS/macOS deployment support

### Advanced Features
- **Evaluation Framework**: GLUE, SuperGLUE, MMLU, HellaSwag, HumanEval benchmarks
- **Monitoring**: TensorBoard integration, gradient flow analysis, activation statistics
- **Caching System**: Multiple eviction policies (LRU, LFU, ARC, Hybrid)
- **A/B Testing**: Infrastructure for model comparison
- **Model Compression**: Pruning and distillation support
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom kernels and layers
- **Tensor Debugger**: Interactive watchpoints, NaN/Inf detection, operation tracing

### Distributed and Parallel Computing
- **Tensor Parallelism**: Column/row parallel linear layers
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Stage-based model partitioning
- **Data Parallelism**: Multi-GPU training infrastructure
- **Communication Backends**: NCCL, MPI, Gloo support
- **Process Groups**: All-reduce, broadcast, all-gather, reduce-scatter operations

### PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
- **LoRA**: Low-rank adaptation with weight merging
- **QLoRA**: Quantized LoRA for memory efficiency
- **Adapters**: Bottleneck adapter layers
- **Prefix Tuning**: Trainable prefix embeddings
- **Prompt Tuning**: Virtual token optimization

## Usage Example

```rust
use trustformers_core::layers::{Linear, LayerNorm, MultiHeadAttention};
use trustformers_core::tensor::Tensor;
use trustformers_core::traits::Layer;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create layers for a transformer block
    let attention = MultiHeadAttention::new(768, 12, 0.1, true)?;
    let norm1 = LayerNorm::new(vec![768], 1e-5)?;
    let ffn = Linear::new(768, 3072, true);
    let norm2 = LayerNorm::new(vec![768], 1e-5)?;

    // Run the attention sub-layer's forward pass
    let input = Tensor::randn(&[2, 128, 768])?;
    let attended = attention.forward(input)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Performance

- **FlashAttention**: O(N) memory complexity vs O(N²) standard
- **Quantization**: 50-75% memory reduction with INT8/INT4
- **SIMD**: 2-3x speedup on supported operations
- **PagedAttention**: Eliminates KV cache fragmentation

## Testing

The crate includes comprehensive test coverage. Workspace-wide (default features), `cargo nextest run --workspace` most recently measured 21,370 passed / 41 skipped / 0 failed (2026-08-26; see root `README.md`/`TODO.md` for the current figure, as this grows over time and this crate's own share was not separately re-measured this pass):
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Memory leak detection
- Performance benchmarks
- Cross-backend compatibility tests
- Numerical stability tests with adaptive tolerance

## Dependencies

- `scirs2-core`: SIMD operations and parallelism
- `half`: FP16/BF16 support
- `rayon`: Parallel iteration (via SciRS2)
- `oxicuda-{blas,dnn,memory,driver}` (optional, `cuda` feature): CUDA GEMM, resident attention, and refcounted GPU buffer management
- Various serialization and utility crates

## Public API

The crate exposes **~4,533 public API items** (structs, enums, traits, and fns across the public API, including impl blocks — broader than a prior doc revision's narrower top-level-only count) covering tensors, layers, attention, quantization, export, evaluation, monitoring, distributed computing, PEFT, kernel tuning, and memory management.
