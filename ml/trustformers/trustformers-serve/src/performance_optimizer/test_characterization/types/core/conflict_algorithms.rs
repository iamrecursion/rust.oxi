//! Resource-conflict detection algorithms.
//!
//! These are the [`ConflictDetectionAlgorithm`] implementations that
//! [`ResourceConflictDetector`](crate::performance_optimizer::test_characterization::concurrency_detector::ResourceConflictDetector)
//! runs over a test's recorded [`ResourceAccessPattern`]s.
//!
//! ## Changed in 0.2.1
//!
//! Every algorithm in this file used to ignore its `access_patterns` argument
//! entirely and return `Ok(Vec::new())` under a `// Simplified ... conflict
//! detection` comment. The detector took that empty vector as a measurement:
//! it fed it to `calculate_detection_confidence`, which returns `1.0` for an
//! empty slice, and published "no conflicts, confidence 1.00" for every test it
//! was ever given. Each algorithm now derives its answer from the input:
//!
//! * [`StaticConflictDetectionAlgorithm`] compares the declared access types on
//!   a resource against that resource's declared sharing capability.
//! * [`DynamicConflictDetectionAlgorithm`] reads the [`ContentionEvent`](crate::performance_optimizer::test_characterization::types::locking::ContentionEvent)s that
//!   were actually recorded during the run.
//! * [`PredictiveConflictDetectionAlgorithm`] projects the recorded per-access
//!   timing forward and looks for overlapping future access windows.
//!
//! A fourth implementation, `MLConflictDetectionAlgorithm`, was **deleted**
//! rather than fixed. It carried a `model: String` naming a model
//! (`"default"`, `"svm"`) that does not exist anywhere in this crate, and no
//! trained conflict classifier exists in-tree for it to call; it could only
//! ever have answered by fabricating. The one real model type nearby,
//! `PredictionModel`, holds no coefficients and reports as much (see
//! `types/core/mod.rs`).
