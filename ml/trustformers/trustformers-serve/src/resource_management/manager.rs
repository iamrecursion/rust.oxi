/// `ResourceManagementSystem` used to also own a `config`, a
/// [`ResourceMonitor`], a `CleanupManager` and a `SystemStatistics`. All four
/// were constructed in `new`, stored, and never read again by any code path in
/// this crate — the system never sampled the monitor, never ran the cleanup
/// manager, and never published the statistics. Holding them made the struct
/// read as if it monitored and cleaned up; it did not.
///
/// They were removed rather than wired up, because wiring them means deciding
/// what a monitoring cadence and a cleanup policy should be, and that decision
/// belongs to whoever needs the behaviour — at which point the components can
/// come back as fields that something actually reads. What remains is the set
/// of managers the allocation path really calls.
