//! GPU Manager Types
//!
//! This module contains all types, configurations, and data structures used by the GPU manager
//! system for comprehensive GPU resource management, monitoring, and optimization.
//!
//! # Organization
//!
//! The types are organized into functional categories:
//! - **Error Types**: Error handling and result types
//! - **Configuration Types**: System and component configuration structures
//! - **Core Data Types**: Fundamental GPU device and allocation types
//! - **Metrics Types**: Real-time and historical monitoring data
//! - **Health and Status Types**: Device health monitoring and status tracking
//! - **Alert Types**: Alert system configuration and event types
//! - **Performance Types**: Benchmarking and performance analysis
//! - **Load Balancing Types**: Load distribution strategies and data
//! - **Enums**: All enumeration types for various categorizations
//! - **Traits**: Interface definitions for extensibility
//! - **Type Aliases**: Convenience type aliases
//!
//! All types maintain backward compatibility and include comprehensive documentation
//! with derive macros for serialization, debugging, and other common operations.
