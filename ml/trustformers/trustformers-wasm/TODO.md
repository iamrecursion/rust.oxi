#### Performance Monitoring

**Real-time analytics and optimization**

> **Honesty pass (Wave 6, 2026-08-25).** Before this pass, `performance_profiler.rs` fabricated most of what it reported: `estimate_cpu_usage`/`estimate_gpu_usage` were `50.0 + (Date::now() % 100.0) / 2.0`-style formulas (not measurements of anything); `get_battery_level` returned a hardcoded `0.8` even on the branch where the real Battery API was detected; `cache_hit_rate` was a hardcoded `0.85` on every sample; GPU memory/FLOPs/memory-bandwidth/cache-hits/input-output-shape were constant lookup tables keyed only by operation type; CPU/GPU temperatures and "thermal state" were built from those same fabricated numbers (one branch even checked for a `navigator.thermalState` property that is not a real browser API) and fed a `check_thermal_throttling` detector that logged "Thermal throttling detected" and switched optimization strategy on entirely invented data; the "ML-powered" strategy-improvement estimate was a hardcoded per-transition-pair multiplier table (e.g. `2.5` for CPU→GPU) multiplied by factors derived from the same fabricated CPU/GPU usage. None of this is recoverable as real measurement: no standard browser API exposes CPU/GPU utilization, GPU memory usage, or device temperature/thermal-throttling state to a web page (WebGPU deliberately omits utilization/memory queries to resist fingerprinting). Below reflects what the profiler does now.

- ✅ **Profiling** (real measurements only)
  - Operation-level wall-clock timing (`duration_ms`, real)
  - Real WASM linear-memory growth per operation (`wasm_memory_growth_bytes`, via `get_wasm_memory_usage()`) and real peak WASM memory (`memory_peak`)
  - Bottleneck detection (slow-operation classification now uses the caller-supplied real `operation_type`, e.g. `GPUKernel`, instead of a fabricated CPU/GPU time split that could never actually produce a GPU classification)
  - ❌ Removed (not measurable from a web page, and not kept as a permanently-`None` placeholder): CPU/GPU utilization monitoring, GPU memory/FLOPs/memory-bandwidth/cache-hit tracking, per-operation input/output shape (would require changing `start_operation`'s signature to accept shape data it does not currently receive)

- ✅ **Adaptive Optimization** (strategy switching is real; the "how much better" estimate is not claimed)
  - Automatic strategy switching - real: triggered by caller-supplied `latency_ms`/`throughput`/`memory_mb`/`accuracy` crossing real thresholds in `check_and_trigger_adaptation`
  - `AdaptationRecord.improvement_ratio`/`.confidence_score` are `Option`, always `None` as of this pass: the profiler never runs the same workload under two strategies to compare and has no trained model, so there is no real basis for a numeric "improvement" or "confidence" at switch time
  - ❌ Removed: "ML-powered performance estimation" (was a hardcoded multiplier table, not a model), thermal-aware optimization / `check_thermal_throttling` (no real thermal signal existed to trigger it), power consumption monitoring (no browser API; was derived from the fabricated CPU/GPU usage above)
  - Real battery level, when available: `PerformanceProfiler::refresh_battery_status()` reads the browser's Battery Status API (`navigator.getBattery()`) the same way `device_capability::DeviceCapabilityDetector` does, and caches it for `sample_resources`/`get_power_recommendations` (renamed from `get_thermal_recommendations`, which is gone along with the fabricated thermal branch it used to emit)

---

## WebGPU Notes

This crate has **no dependency on the native `wgpu` crate**. WebGPU support is implemented by calling the browser's WebGPU API directly through hand-written `web-sys`/`js-sys` bindings:

- **Types**: `GpuAdapter`, `GpuDevice`, `GpuQueue`, etc. are `js_sys::Object` aliases (`src/compute/webgpu/types.rs`), with extension traits (`GpuDeviceExt`, `GpuAdapterExt`, `GpuQueueExt`, `GpuBufferExt`) that use JS reflection for methods web-sys doesn't bind natively.
- **Device negotiation**: `navigator.gpu` → `requestAdapter()` → `requestDevice()`, each awaited via `wasm_bindgen_futures::JsFuture` with explicit null/undefined checks (`GpuTensor::init_webgpu` in `src/compute/gpu_tensor.rs`; `WebGPUOps::initialize` in `src/compute/webgpu_simple.rs`).
- **Shared backend handle**: the negotiated backend is wrapped in `Rc<RefCell<WebGPUBackend>>` (`src/compute/gpu_tensor.rs`) for cheap sharing across derived tensors plus interior mutability for pipeline caching; `RefCell` borrows are scoped so none is ever held across an `.await`.
- **CPU fallback is real** at multiple levels: `WebGPUBackend::is_available()` probes for `navigator.gpu` before attempting GPU init; `GpuTensorFactory::create_tensor` falls back silently on any initialization error; per-op methods on `GpuTensor` (`matmul`/`add`/`relu`) route to CPU tensor math whenever no GPU backend is active.
- **Two dispatch paths of different completeness** coexist — know which one you're using:
  - `WebGPUOps` (`src/compute/webgpu_simple.rs`) is fully wired end-to-end: it compiles 7 real WGSL compute shaders (matmul, add, relu, sigmoid, tanh, gelu, softmax), builds storage buffers/bind groups/command encoders, dispatches compute passes, and reads results back via a staging buffer + `map_async`/`getMappedRange`.
  - `WebGPUBackend`/`SimpleGpuOps` (`src/compute/webgpu/backend.rs`, `simple_ops.rs`) — the path behind the `Rc<RefCell>`-wrapped `GpuTensor` — allocate real GPU buffers and pipelines, but their dispatch methods (`dispatch_add`/`dispatch_relu`/`dispatch_matmul`, and `SimpleGpuOps::matmul`/`softmax`/`layer_norm`/`attention`) currently execute the CPU fallback path by explicit documented design; GPU dispatch for these ops isn't wired in yet.
  - **Recommendation**: use `WebGPUOps` directly if you need guaranteed end-to-end GPU execution today; `GpuTensor` is convenient but currently CPU-backed for most ops even when a GPU device was successfully acquired.

---

## Known Limitations

- WebGPU not available in all browsers yet (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+, Safari experimental)
- SharedArrayBuffer requires cross-origin isolation
- SIMD requires browser support for WASM SIMD128
- Some WebGPU features limited by web-sys 0.3.95 API availability
- Large models may require quantization for browser deployment
- `WebGPUBackend`/`SimpleGpuOps` (the dispatch path behind `GpuTensor`) currently execute the CPU fallback for matmul/add/relu/softmax/layer_norm/attention by documented design — use `WebGPUOps` directly for guaranteed end-to-end GPU dispatch today (see "WebGPU Notes")
- 0 `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()` macros in source. Several previously-documented simplifications were fixed this release: `RecoveryAction::ClearCache` now really clears the browser's Cache Storage instead of being a no-op (`src/error.rs`); quantization stats and the `apply_dynamic/static/post_training_quantization` math are now real, bit-width-aware affine quantize/dequantize instead of a fixed-constant multiplier (`src/optimization/quantization/quantizer.rs`, `algorithms/basic.rs`); and device-capability probes now query the real browser APIs instead of returning hardcoded/default values (`detect_webgl_support`/`get_screen_orientation` in `src/device_capability/detector.rs`, `compute::webgpu::get_device_capabilities()` in `src/compute/webgpu/mod.rs`). One simplification remains: synthesized `blob:`/`data:` URLs in place of `URL.createObjectURL()` (`src/storage/model_splitting.rs`, `src/compute/threads.rs`)
- **Wave 6 honesty pass (2026-08-25)**: this crate was never covered by Waves 1-5 (highest marker-hit count in the workspace census) and had six live fabrication clusters, all fixed this pass:
  - `performance_profiler.rs` - see the "Performance Monitoring" section above for the full account (fabricated CPU/GPU/temperature/thermal/power telemetry and a hardcoded "ML-powered" improvement estimate removed; real WASM-memory and Battery-API measurements kept/added).
  - `storage/indexeddb.rs` - `store_model` used to store payloads over 1MiB raw while labeling the record `CompressionType::Gzip` (and checksummed that mislabeled payload); `get_model` silently returned `Gzip`/`Brotli` records unchanged. Now: real DEFLATE via `oxiarc_deflate` (`CompressionType::Deflate`), real SHA-256 checksums (`ModelStorage::calculate_checksum`) with a legacy-byte-sum-compatible read path (`verify_checksum`) so old records stay readable, `Gzip` kept only as a documented legacy marker (never written, read back as-is since it never really held compressed bytes), and `Brotli` returns a structured error rather than a silent passthrough.
  - `runtime/edge_caching.rs` - `prefetch()` used to insert 1KiB of zero bytes under each queued key after a fake 50-150ms delay, so a subsequent `get()` returned fabricated data as a real cache hit. `EdgeCacheManager` has no origin-fetch machinery of its own (only opaque keys, no URLs/fetch callback), so `prefetch()` now drains the queue and reports how many entries were left un-prefetched, without touching the cache or its statistics.
  - `export/coreml.rs` - `to_mlmodel_json()` (renamed `export_coreml_json()`) produces a JSON intermediate representation of the exported graph, not a real `.mlmodel`. This was already true before the rename; the method name and module doc comment previously implied otherwise. **Deferred**: a real `.mlmodel`/`.mlpackage` protobuf encoder (Core ML's actual on-disk format; see `CoreML.proto` in Apple's `coremltools`) is not implemented and is out of scope for one wave.
  - `storage/model_splitting.rs` - `ModelLoadingSession::load_by_priority` used to run a `setTimeout` sized "100ms per MB" per chunk and drive `loading_progress` to 100% while `loaded_components`/`loaded_size` stayed untouched. The chunk bytes are already resident (populated by `split_model`), so loading is real synchronous work now: each chunk is actually decompressed and checksum-verified (`resolve_chunk_data`), `loaded_components`/`loaded_size` are updated as chunks are materialized, and progress is derived from real state - no invented delay, and a corrupted chunk now fails instead of being reported loaded.
  - `storage/progressive_loader.rs` - `ChunkMetadata.checksum` used to be `format!("chunk_{i}")` (the chunk index restated as a string) and nothing ever verified it. `ChunkLoader::split_into_chunks` only ever computes byte *ranges* from a byte count - it never holds the chunk's actual bytes - so no real checksum could be computed here; the field was deleted rather than kept as a fabricated-but-unverified placeholder. (Real per-chunk integrity checking lives in `model_splitting::ModelChunk`, which does hold the bytes at split time.)
  - `multi_model_manager.rs` - `warmup_model` used to transition `WarmingUp -> Ready` and set `warmup_completed = true` with no code (and therefore no actual inference) between the two status writes. It now runs a real minimal forward pass (a single token id 0 in a `[1, 1]` tensor) through the model's actual loaded weights, and only reports `warmup_completed = true` on genuine success; on failure the model is left `ModelStatus::Error` and the error propagates to `load_model`'s caller. `LoadedModel.gpu_memory_usage` (previously a hardcoded `0`) is now `Option<usize>`, `None` - no browser API measures GPU memory usage.

## 0.2.0 Release Scope

Two workspace-wide tracks land in 0.2.0: (1) **OxiCUDA GPU migration** — moving GPU acceleration from scirs2-core's `gpu` feature to the OxiCUDA stack (~/work/oxicuda, oxicuda 0.4.x already integrated in trustformers-core behind the `cuda`/`metal` features); this crate's WebGPU compute is web-sys-based and unaffected, but its dead scirs2 wiring is cleaned up as part of the same sweep. (2) **PyTorch (tch) dependency removal** — the tch dependency and the `torch` feature are deleted entirely in 0.2.0 (workspace Cargo.toml:82, trustformers-core torch feature + ~40 lines of cfg arms, and the forwarder features in trustformers, trustformers-training, trustformers-c); ToRSh is NOT adopted as a replacement now (a P2 task tracks evaluating an optional `torsh-interop` feature in 0.3.x once torsh 0.2.0 ships on crates.io), and the unused candle-nn workspace dep is dropped while the `candle` feature/variant is kept through 0.2.0. Neither tch nor candle touches this crate, so the tch track requires no trustformers-wasm changes.

### OxiCUDA GPU migration (scirs2-core gpu → OxiCUDA)

- [x] **[P1]** Remove the dead optional scirs2-core dependency and the `scirs2` feature
  - `trustformers-wasm/src` contained ZERO scirs2 references; the crate declared an optional scirs2-core dep (Cargo.toml:33) activated by the `scirs2` feature (:67), which was also listed in `performance-optimized` (:48) and `full` (:69). Dep, feature, and its entries in both feature lists removed. The crate's WebGPU compute is web-sys-based and unaffected; `src/compute/webgpu/backend.rs:79,95` (`is_available`/`is_shared_memory_supported`) do not reference scirs2 and needed no changes.
  - Superseded the "SCIRS2 (optional dependency)" status line above and the corresponding `scirs2` entries in the "Feature Flags" snippet.
  - Verify: `cargo check -p trustformers-wasm --features full` (wasm32 target) green with no scirs2-core in `cargo tree`.

### PyTorch (tch) dependency removal

- No trustformers-wasm tasks: this crate has no tch/torch or candle dependency. The 0.2.0 deletion of the `torch` feature and the 0.3.x `torsh-interop` evaluation (P2) are tracked in the root TODO.md and the affected crates (trustformers-core, trustformers, trustformers-training). Status update (2026-07-06): the torch/tch removal landed this session across the workspace (root Cargo.toml, trustformers-core, trustformers, trustformers-training) — confirmed via `rg` that no `tch`/`feature = "torch"` references remain outside harmless prose/comments. **Superseded: trustformers-c deprecated** — its `torch` forwarder feature removal is moot since trustformers-c's own TODO.md was rewritten as a deprecation notice this session (C FFI surface superseded by the pure-Rust core plus trustformers-wasm and other language-binding crates); no further trustformers-c-specific tracking is needed here.

---

## Future Enhancements

### High Priority
- [ ] Enhanced WebGPU kernel optimizations as browser APIs stabilize
  - **Refinement needed:** which ops? target speedup % vs baseline? Specific WebGPU compute shader patterns.
- [ ] TensorRT/ONNX export for edge optimization
  - **Note:** ONNX export must use oxionnx per COOLJAPAN policy; TensorRT is NVIDIA-only.
- [ ] AutoGPTQ/BitsAndBytes quantization
  - **Note:** BitsAndBytes is Python-only. Consider: Pure Rust quantization equivalents already in trustformers-core.
- [ ] WebNN maturity tracking (currently experimental)
  - **Refinement needed:** this is a browser-spec tracking task, not implementation. Define: which WebNN API level (currently at CR status)? Target browsers?

### Correctness & De-Simplification
- [x] Wire real GPU dispatch for matmul/add/relu — **done, verified 2026-08-18**: `trustformers-wasm/src/compute/gpu_tensor.rs` dispatches all three under `#[cfg(feature = "webgpu")]` (`backend.borrow_mut().dispatch_matmul(...)` at `:139`, `backend.borrow().dispatch_add(...)` at `:167`, `backend.borrow().dispatch_relu(...)` at `:196`), each with a CPU fallback. This item had been sitting open after the work landed; the real remaining WASM GPU gap is the broader kernel set (`layer_norm`/`attention`, explicitly out of scope for this item from the start), not these three ops.
- [x] Implement real cache clearing for RecoveryAction::ClearCache (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal: the ClearCache recovery action (triggered on OOM/storage-quota errors) actually clears something instead of Ok(())-no-op.
  - Design: self-contained fix using the browser Cache Storage API directly (window.caches().keys() -> caches.delete(key) for each) — matches the existing style of the sibling ReduceMemoryUsage arm right next to it. (3 other real cache-clearing mechanisms exist elsewhere in the crate but deliberately NOT wired through here, to avoid coupling this fix to optional feature flags.)
  - Files: trustformers-wasm/src/error.rs only.
  - Tests: the E4001/E7001 -> ClearCache mapping is testable natively; the actual browser-API call needs wasm-bindgen-test in browser mode.
  - Risk: low.
- [x] Make quantization bit-width-aware: get_stats() + apply_* math (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal: get_stats() and the apply_dynamic/static/post_training_quantization functions stop assuming a fixed 4-bytes/element regardless of requested precision.
  - Design: add impl QuantizationPrecision { fn bits(&self) -> u32 } covering all 8 variants explicitly (including an explicit, not silently-defaulted, decision for Mixed/Adaptive), mirroring trustformers-core's QuantDtype::bits()/bytes_per_element() exactly. Wire get_stats() to use real byte counts; replace the 3 apply_* functions' fixed-constant scaling with real affine quantize/dequantize.
  - Files: trustformers-wasm/src/optimization/quantization/config.rs, quantizer.rs, algorithms/basic.rs.
  - Tests: fully native, no browser needed — pure functions. Assert get_stats reports ~0.5x size for INT4 vs FP32; assert apply_* actually clips into the bit-width's representable range.
  - Risk: Mixed/Adaptive don't have one fixed bit-width by design — document the chosen nominal value explicitly. (Note: algorithms/advanced.rs has the identical anti-pattern, out of scope here.)
- [x] Real device-capability detection: get_device_capabilities() + probe functions (planned 2026-07-05)
  - Goal: get_device_capabilities(), detect_webgl_support, get_screen_orientation stop returning hardcoded defaults.
  - Design: get_device_capabilities() — make the already-correct, already-real DeviceSelector::analyze_device_capabilities() pub(crate) and call it instead of DeviceCapabilities::default() (near-zero-risk). detect_webgl_support — canvas + webgl2/webgl context + real parameter queries, mirroring the file's own existing detect_gpu_info pattern. get_screen_orientation — window.screen()?.orientation() -> real OrientationType match.
  - Files: trustformers-wasm/src/compute/webgpu/mod.rs, device_selector.rs (visibility change only), src/device_capability/detector.rs.
  - Tests: needs wasm-pack test --chrome --headless or the existing Playwright suite (nothing natively testable — needs window/navigator/a real adapter).
  - Risk: do NOT also "fix" detect_low_power_mode in this pass — confirmed no standardized cross-browser API exists for it at all; if touched, must be documented as a best-effort heuristic, not presented as equally real as the other three. Leaving it as-is is acceptable for this batch.
- [x] (same fix as get_stats() bit-width-aware item above — implemented once, not twice) (planned 2026-07-05)
- [ ] Use real `URL.createObjectURL()` once available in web-sys instead of synthesized `blob:`/`data:` URL strings (`src/storage/model_splitting.rs`, `src/compute/threads.rs`)
- [x] (same fix as the device-capability-detection item above — implemented once, not twice) (planned 2026-07-05)

### Performance
- [ ] Multi-Query Attention optimization (MQA reduces KV memory in WASM context)
- Memory compression techniques
- Better network transfer strategies
- [ ] Speculative decoding in WASM (draft model + target model speculative decoding for faster WASM inference)

### Features
- More framework integrations
- Additional edge platform support
- Enhanced mobile capabilities
- Real-time collaboration features

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- **TypeScript:** All public APIs have TypeScript definitions
- **Testing:** Plain `cargo test`/`cargo nextest` (host target) for the ~130 in-source Rust unit tests; Playwright/Jest (`tests/*.js`) for the separate browser/E2E suite
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive inline documentation
- **Naming:** snake_case for Rust, camelCase for JavaScript/TypeScript

### Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Build for web
wasm-pack build --target web --release

# Build for bundler (webpack, rollup)
wasm-pack build --target bundler --release

# Build for Node.js
wasm-pack build --target nodejs --release

# Minimal build (size-optimized)
wasm-pack build --target web --release -- --features minimal

# Full build (all features except webgpu; combine with --features full,webgpu for GPU too)
wasm-pack build --target web --release -- --features full

# Run the Rust unit tests (host target; no browser required)
cargo test
cargo nextest run

# Run with specific features
cargo test --features webgpu

# Check that the actual wasm32 build compiles
cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Run the browser/E2E JS suite (from tests/)
cd tests && npm test               # Jest-based suite
cd tests && npx playwright test    # Playwright cross-browser/e2e suite

# Optimize WASM binary
