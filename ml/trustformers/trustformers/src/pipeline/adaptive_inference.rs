//! Adaptive inference: input-driven precision/skip *recommendations*, plus a
//! genuinely real early-exit execution path for models that expose one.
//!
//! # What is real here, and what is a recommendation
//!
//! [`AdaptiveInferenceEngine::adaptive_inference`] accepts any
//! `P: Pipeline<Output = PipelineOutput>`. The plain [`Pipeline`] trait
//! exposes exactly one hook -- `__call__`, a whole-model call -- so there is
//! no way to actually run, skip, or change the precision of an individual
//! layer of an arbitrary `P`. Given that constraint:
//!
//! - `InputAnalyzer::analyze_input` is real: for textual input (the
//!   overwhelmingly common `Pipeline::Input` in this crate) it computes
//!   genuine, deterministic, content-derived measurements (word count,
//!   vocabulary diversity, per-token importance, ...). It never returns a
//!   fixed constant for text input.
//! - Per-layer precision/skip choices (`precision_history`, `skip_history`,
//!   `AdaptationDecision`s produced by [`AdaptiveInferenceEngine::adaptive_inference`])
//!   are real, input-derived *recommendations* -- genuinely computed from
//!   [`InputAnalysis`], genuinely recorded, genuinely readable back out --
//!   but they are never applied to computation, because there is no hook to
//!   apply them to. What actually executes is always either the real
//!   early-exit path below, or an unconditional full `base_pipeline` call.
//!   `AdaptationDecision::decision_type` and `reason` say "recommended", not
//!   "applied", "skipped", or "used".
//! - [`AdaptiveInferenceEngine::adaptive_inference_layerwise`] is the real
//!   execution path: for a `P` that also implements
//!   [`crate::pipeline::early_exit::LayerwiseInference`], it drives
//!   [`EarlyExitPipeline::run`] directly, and every layer-count/timing/
//!   confidence number it reports comes from layers that actually ran.
//! - Resource telemetry (`memory_peak_mb`, `energy_consumed_watts`, CPU
//!   headroom folded into `resource_efficiency`) is sampled via
//!   [`crate::profiler::read_process_memory`] and
//!   `crate::pipeline::sampled_cpu_utilization` -- real host measurements,
//!   not fixed constants. There is no energy telemetry source wired into
//!   this workspace, so `energy_consumed_watts` is honestly `0.0`.
