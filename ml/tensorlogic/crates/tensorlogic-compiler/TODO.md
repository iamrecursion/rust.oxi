- [x] **InlineConfig** (`inline.rs`): Builder-style configuration controlling `max_depth` for recursive inlining, `inline_once` (only inline single-use bindings), `always_inline` (force inline regardless of use count), and `size_threshold` (skip inlining when the bound expression exceeds the node-count limit)
- [x] **InlineStats** (`inline.rs`): Collects `bindings_inlined` count, total `substitutions_performed`, and a `converged` flag indicating whether the fixed-point was reached within the configured pass limit
- [x] **count_free_occurrences** (`inline.rs`): Recursive function counting the number of free occurrences of a named variable in a `TLExpr` tree, respecting `Let`/`Lambda` binding scopes to avoid counting shadowed uses
- [x] **capture-avoiding substitute** (`inline.rs`): Core alpha-renaming-based substitution function that replaces free occurrences of a variable with an expression, renaming binders to fresh names when substitution would otherwise capture a free variable in the replacement

## v0.1.15

- [x] **ConstantPropagator** (`const_prop.rs`): Bottom-up constant-folding pass over `TLExpr` trees; traverses all variants and substitutes fully-constant sub-expressions with their evaluated `Num` or boolean literal results until a fixed point is reached or `ConstPropConfig::max_passes` is exceeded
- [x] **ConstPropStats** (`const_prop.rs`): Collects per-pass and cumulative counts of folded nodes, total passes performed, and a `converged` flag indicating whether the fixed point was reached within the configured pass limit
- [x] **ConstPropConfig** (`const_prop.rs`): Builder-style configuration controlling `max_passes`, and per-category fold toggles: `fold_arithmetic` (Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Pow), `fold_comparison` (Eq/Lt/Gt/Le/Ge), `fold_boolean` (AND/OR/NOT with short-circuit)
- [x] **Arithmetic folding** (`const_prop.rs`): Folds `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Pow` nodes whose both operands reduce to `Num` literals; division by zero produces `NaN`-literal rather than panicking
- [x] **Comparison folding** (`const_prop.rs`): Evaluates `Eq`, `Lt`, `Gt`, `Le`, `Ge` between constant `Num` operands, replacing the comparison node with `TRUE` or `FALSE` `Atom` literals
- [x] **Boolean folding** (`const_prop.rs`): Short-circuit folds `AND(FALSE, _) → FALSE`, `AND(TRUE, x) → x`, `OR(TRUE, _) → TRUE`, `OR(FALSE, x) → x`, `NOT(TRUE) → FALSE`, `NOT(FALSE) → TRUE`

## v0.1.17

- [x] **CompilerPipeline** (`pipeline.rs`): Composable pass chain driving all compilation phases end-to-end, from parsing through optimisation to code generation, with configurable pass selection via `CompilerPipelineConfig`
- [x] **CompilerPipelineConfig** (`pipeline.rs`): Builder-style configuration with feature-gate toggles for each pass category (scope analysis, type checking, DCE, CSE, constant propagation, inlining, rewriting), enabling minimal or maximal pipeline configurations
- [x] **CompilerPassOrder** (`pipeline.rs`): Enum encoding the canonical ordering of compilation passes; supports dependency-aware ordering to prevent applying downstream passes before their prerequisites
- [x] **CompilerPassStats** (`pipeline.rs`): Per-pass timing (wall-clock nanoseconds) and nodes-affected counters reported after each pass completes, enabling fine-grained profiling of individual pipeline stages
- [x] **CompilerPipelineStats** (`pipeline.rs`): Aggregate pipeline-level metrics combining per-pass `CompilerPassStats`, total compilation time, overall nodes eliminated, and a `slowest_pass()` helper
- [x] **PassBenchmark** (`pipeline.rs`): Micro-benchmark harness for individual passes — runs a pass N times, reports mean/min/max wall-clock duration, and flags regressions against a configurable baseline threshold
- [x] **`inline.rs` sub-module refactor**: `LetInliner` and helpers extracted into a focused `inline/` sub-directory; `inline/mod.rs` re-exports the public API unchanged for backward compatibility
- [x] **`augmentation.rs` sub-module refactor**: `AugmentationPipeline` and transform helpers extracted into `augmentation/` sub-directory with focused modules per transform family (noise, crop, mix, normalize)

## v0.1.19 (2026-04-05)

- [x] **Partial Evaluation / Specialization** (`partial_eval.rs`): `PEEnv` binding map from variable names to `PEValue` (Constant, Bool, Symbolic); `PEConfig` with toggles for arithmetic folding, boolean folding, branch pruning, let-inlining, and configurable max depth/inline threshold; `PEStats` tracking nodes visited, reduced, and inlined; `partially_evaluate()` single-pass reducer; `specialize()` convenience wrapper binding a named argument; `specialize_batch()` multi-argument specialization; handles all arithmetic/logic/fuzzy/temporal operators with short-circuit branch pruning (IfThenElse under known condition) and let-inlining at or below the inline-size threshold.

- [x] **Symbolic Differentiation** (`symbolic_diff.rs`): `differentiate()` computes symbolic derivatives of `TLExpr` with respect to a named variable; `jacobian()` builds the full Jacobian vector for a list of output expressions; `simplify_derivative()` applies algebraic simplification rules (zero/identity elimination, constant folding); `DiffConfig` controls simplification depth and intermediate caching; `DiffResult` carries the differentiated expression plus a `simplified` flag. Supports all arithmetic operators (`Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Pow`, `Neg`), logical operators (`And`, `Or`, `Not`, `Implies`), fuzzy operators (`TNorm`, `TCoNorm`), temporal operators (`Eventually`, `Always`, `Until`), and probabilistic expressions.
