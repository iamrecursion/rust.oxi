  - [x] Predicate, conjunction, quantifier tests
  - [x] Nested expressions and quantifiers
  - [x] Parallel vs serial inference comparison
  - [x] All 14 tests passing
- [x] `fuzzing-robustness` (planned 2026-04-17)
  - **Goal:** Add proptest property suites + cargo-fuzz harnesses around hook serialization/deserialization and the tensor adapter input-parsing boundary; catch panics and malformed-input crashes.
  - **Design:** proptest strategies for hook payloads (size + arity bounded). Properties: round-trip serialize/deserialize, no panics on arbitrary `&[u8]` deserialize, idempotence of normalization. cargo-fuzz target `fuzz_targets/adapter_parse.rs` — feed arbitrary bytes into the adapter input parser; assertion: never panics, returns `Result`. Feature-gate cargo-fuzz pieces under `[features] fuzzing = []` so default builds stay stable-friendly.
  - **Files:** `tests/proptest_hooks.rs` (NEW); `fuzz/Cargo.toml` (NEW — excluded from workspace, built via `cargo +nightly fuzz`); `fuzz/fuzz_targets/adapter_parse.rs` (NEW); `Cargo.toml` (add `proptest` dev-dep, `[features] fuzzing = []`).
  - **Prerequisites:** none.
  - **Tests:** proptest cases (round-trip, no-panic, idempotent); `cargo build -p tensorlogic-quantrs-hooks-fuzz` compiles on nightly.
  - **Risk:** cargo-fuzz needs nightly — mitigation: keep `fuzz/` excluded from the workspace; full fuzz runs are out of scope for CI.
  - **Refinement (2026-04-17):** Audit confirms implementation exceeds original plan (6 proptest properties vs. 3 planned; 2 fuzz targets vs. 1 planned; Cargo.toml deps + feature gate present). Only verification step remains: run tests + clippy, confirm fuzz/ harness compiles, then flip marker to [x].

Full integration with `FactorGraph` and `MessagePassingAlgorithm` trait. References: Yedidia, Freeman & Weiss (2003); Koller & Friedman (2009).

### Not Yet Implemented (Future)
- GPU acceleration hooks (via SciRS2)
- Fuzzing for robustness

## v0.2.0 Research Preview (2026-04-15)

- [x] **Variational Message Passing** (`vmp/`): Coordinate-ascent engine for conjugate-exponential families. Three families supported in the research preview: Gaussian (mean-unknown, precision-known), Categorical, and Dirichlet, each implementing a common `ExponentialFamily` trait over natural parameters. Four conjugate factor relationships: `GaussianObservation`, `GaussianStep`, `DirichletCategorical`, `CategoricalObservation`. Monotone ELBO with `divergence_tolerance` surfacing numerical breakdowns as `PgmError::ConvergenceFailure`. Optional validation against an existing `FactorGraph` via `VariationalMessagePassing::with_graph`. Local `ln_gamma` / `digamma` in `special.rs` (scirs2-special free), closed-form KL helpers for all three families. 17 module-level tests + 10 engine unit tests + 3 BayesianNetwork integration tests, all green under `cargo clippy -D warnings`. Reference: Winn & Bishop (2005), JMLR 6, 661-694.

## v0.2.0 / Future Work

- [x] ~~Expanded VMP family catalogue (Gamma, Beta)~~ — `vmp/gamma.rs` (GammaNP + Gamma-Poisson conjugacy, 8 unit tests) and `vmp/beta.rs` (BetaNP + Beta-Bernoulli conjugacy, 9 unit tests), both implementing ExponentialFamily with closed-form KL. Two end-to-end integration tests (100 Poisson counts, 200 Bernoulli draws). Remaining: ~~mixture components~~, structured mean-field.
- [x] **Variational Bayes Gaussian Mixture Model** (`vmp/mixture.rs`) — `VariationalGaussianMixture` fitter implementing the full VBEM (coordinate-ascent variational EM) algorithm for univariate Gaussian mixtures with conjugate Dirichlet/Gaussian priors. `VgmmConfig` builder (symmetric Dirichlet α₀, Gaussian prior m₀/β₀, per-component or shared observation precision τ_k, seed, max_iterations, tolerance, divergence_tolerance). `VgmmResult` with soft responsibilities N×K, K posterior `GaussianNP` components, `DirichletNP` weight posterior, ELBO history, convergence flag. E-step uses `DirichletNP::expected_sufficient_statistics` (ψ(αₖ)−ψ(α₀)) for E[ln π_k], numerically stable log-sum-exp normalisation. M-step closed-form conjugate updates (αₖ = α₀+Nₖ, βₖ = β₀+τₖNₖ, mₖ = (β₀m₀+τₖSₖ)/βₖ), empty-component prior fallback. ELBO = Σ_n LSE_n − KL[q(π)||p(π)] − Σₖ KL[q(μₖ)||p(μₖ)] with divergence detection mirroring engine.rs. 10 inline unit tests + 1 end-to-end integration test (150 points, 3 well-separated clusters, mean recovery within 0.8). All 346 tests pass, zero clippy warnings.
- GPU-accelerated inference via QuantRS2.
- [x] ~~Split `src/loopy_bp.rs` (1,744 L) into a `loopy_bp/` directory.~~ (completed 2026-04-15)
