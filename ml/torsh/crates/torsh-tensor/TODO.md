## Known Issues (as of 2025-11-14)

### Build and Testing
- **Standard build**: ✅ All 336 tests pass (100% success rate)
- **cargo fmt**: ✅ Code formatting complete - no issues
- **cargo clippy**: ✅ Zero warnings with `-D warnings` flag
- **--all-features build**: ⚠️ Some feature combinations require scirs2 modules (`gpu`, `profiling`, `tensor_cores`) that are not yet available in the current scirs2 version (v0.3.3). These features are planned for future scirs2 releases. Standard feature combinations work perfectly.

### Recommended Usage
For production use, rely on the standard feature set which has been thoroughly tested and validated. Advanced features requiring unreleased scirs2 modules will be enabled once those modules become available in future scirs2 versions.

## v0.1.2 SIMD Performance Slice

- [x] simd_activation_inplace: In-place SIMD f32 for relu_/leaky_relu_/clamp_ (planned 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** Three pointwise activations without transcendentals use SIMD. sigmoid_/tanh_/gelu_ stay scalar (need transcendentals).
  - **Design:** Add relu_assign_f32/leaky_relu_assign_f32/clamp_assign_f32 to simd_ops_f32.rs; dispatch in math_ops.rs relu_/leaky_relu_/clamp_ (lines 1397, 1507, 1534).
  - **Files:** crates/torsh-tensor/src/simd_ops_f32.rs, crates/torsh-tensor/src/math_ops.rs
  - **Tests:** -0.0 and subnormals; clamp min>max matches PyTorch; bitwise equality with scalar; bench ≥4x

- [x] dhat_alloc_tracking_bench: dhat-based allocation tracking benchmark (planned 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** Proves pool fix reduces total_blocks ≥50% on hot loop (add + add_ + relu_ × 10000 iter).
  - **Design:** alloc_tracking.rs with global_allocator=dhat::Alloc; dhat::HeapStats::get() before/after; harness=false.
  - **Files:** new crates/torsh-tensor/benches/alloc_tracking.rs, crates/torsh-tensor/Cargo.toml
  - **Tests:** smoke run confirms delta_blocks < 1000 post pool fix

- [x] promote_simd_parallel_defaults: Promote simd+parallel into default features (planned 2026-04-19)
  - **Goal:** Out-of-box installs get SIMD/parallel paths. Add scirs2-core/simd to simd feature.
  - **Design:** default = ["std", "simd", "parallel"]; simd feature += scirs2-core/simd; verify --no-default-features --features std still builds.
  - **Files:** crates/torsh-tensor/Cargo.toml, possibly .github/workflows/
  - **Tests:** cargo build default; cargo build --no-default-features --features std

## Stubs to implement (added 2026-07-03 by /stub-check)

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_simd_ops.rs:207 — "TODO: Pass chunk_config to parallel_map_collect_with_config when available"
  - **Approach:** scirs2_core::chunking::ChunkingUtils::chunked_map(data,&ChunkConfig,map_fn) already accepts &ChunkConfig directly (pre-existing API, not from the recent bump) — build indices 0..rows_a and call chunked_map, dropping the current dead-parameter workaround.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Low, behavior-preserving; chunk sizing changes so a quick perf check is warranted.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_simd_ops.rs:387 — "TODO: Pass chunk_config when parallel_map_reduce supports it"
  - **Approach:** scirs2_core::chunking::ChunkingUtils::chunked_reduce(data,&ChunkConfig,identity,reduce_fn) exists and operates directly on the slice; replace call and drop the redundant local CHUNK_SIZE constant.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Low.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: hardware_accelerators.rs:1189 — "TODO: Implement when CPU accelerator APIs are expanded for each vendor"
  - **Approach:** CpuDetectionResult is torsh-tensor's own macro-placeholder type, not external. Branch on real CPU features via is_x86_feature_detected! (precedent in type_conversions.rs, ops/simd/f32_ops.rs) and populate fields directly — no external dep needed.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Capped usefulness until sibling detect_cpu_architecture() also populates real vendor data; Default impl uses unsafe{mem::zeroed()} — pre-existing UB landmine adjacent to any fix.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: hardware_accelerators.rs:1221 — "TODO: Implement when GPU accelerator APIs are expanded for each vendor"
  - **Approach:** same placeholder pattern as :1189 (GpuDetectionResult). Real vendor signal already obtainable via torsh-backend's wgpu AdapterInfo{vendor,device_type} (webgpu/device.rs) rather than inventing new detection.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** More cross-crate coordination than the CPU case; still gated on sibling detect_gpu_hardware() stub.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: hardware_accelerators.rs:1253 — "TODO: Implement when MemoryDetectionResult and optimizer APIs are expanded"
  - **Approach:** unlike CPU/GPU, no existing detection utility in-workspace to build on; needs real OS-level NUMA/cache-topology queries (e.g. /sys/devices/system/node parsing on Linux).
  - **Scope:** large
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Platform-specific, may need a new pure-Rust systems dependency, subject to Pure-Rust policy review.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:93 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats descriptive statistics when API stabilizes"
  - **Approach:** scirs2-stats 0.6.0 exports mean/var/std/skew/kurtosis/moment/percentile/quartiles directly — call instead of manual loops.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Current skew/kurtosis use a nonstandard hybrid convention — switching changes numeric output (correctness fix); pinned-value tests need updating.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:180 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats correlation analysis when API stabilizes"
  - **Approach:** scirs2_stats::corrcoef(view,"pearson"|"spearman"|"kendall") computes the whole matrix in one call; pearsonr/spearmanr/kendalltau give (r,p_value) for significant_pairs.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Spearman/Kendall enum variants exist but are never produced today — new behavior, not just refactor.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:225 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats t-test when API stabilizes"
  - **Approach:** scirs2_stats::ttest_1samp replaces hand-computed stats and crude tanh p-value approximation.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Name collision between scirs2-stats's TTestResult and torsh's own (extra fields) needs field mapping; p-values change (become accurate).

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:274 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats two-sample t-test when available"
  - **Approach:** scirs2_stats::ttest_ind implements both pooled-variance and Welch's-t, matching torsh's equal_variance param 1:1.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Same TTestResult field-mapping issue; p-values change.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:357 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats regression when available"
  - **Approach:** scirs2_stats::linear_regression returns a superset of torsh's result struct; build [1,x] design matrix and map fields.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Uses lstsq internally, no new dep; current hand-rolled SE/F-stat are approximations, library's OLS inference will differ slightly; design-matrix column order (intercept first) must be correct.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:437 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats distribution fitting when available"
  - **Approach:** the literal Fittable trait has zero concrete impls upstream, but composable pieces exist: mean/var(ddof=0) for MLE params, kstest+real Normal for goodness-of-fit, information::{aic,bic} as risk-free drop-ins.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Current code uses ddof=1 for MLE std_dev but true normal MLE variance is ddof=0 — latent pre-existing bug independent of scirs2-stats.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: scirs2_stats_integration.rs:559 — "TODO: Use actual scirs2-stats implementation"
  - **Approach:** private t_cdf(t,df) helper — replace tanh-heuristic body with scirs2_stats::distributions::student_t::StudentT::cdf.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Changes p-values at both t-test call sites; if lines 225/274 migrate to ttest_1samp/ttest_ind wholesale this helper becomes dead code — coordinate to avoid duplicate work.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: core_ops/types.rs:587 — "TODO: Temporarily disabled - backend types not yet available in scirs2_core"
  - **Approach:** is_backend_available hardcodes false, breaking zeros_gpu/ones_gpu. Real detection available in-house: oxicuda-driver::multi_gpu::device_count() for Cuda, torsh_backend::webgpu::is_available() for WebGpu/Metal.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Both detection calls are relatively expensive (live handle / async probe) — should be cached, not called per-invocation on the backend-selection hot path.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: memory_pool.rs:72 — "TODO: profile_section macro not available in scirs2_core yet"
  - **Approach:** scirs2-core 0.6.0 ships pub mod profiling with struct Timer (Drop-based RAII) — exact drop-in replacement at ~7 call sites. Needs "profiling" added to this crate's scirs2-core feature forwarding in Cargo.toml.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Timer::start() takes a global Mutex-guarded Profiler lock each call — could add contention on hot allocation paths; benchmark before wiring broadly.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: memory_pool.rs:927 — "TODO: When mmap-support feature is enabled, use memory-mapped file at backing_path"
  - **Approach:** no "mmap-support" feature exists anywhere (the name is aspirational). torsh-tensor already declares memory_efficient=["scirs2-core/memory_efficient"], which activates scirs2-core's in-house mmap layer (MmapArray, create_mmap, MemoryMappedArray). Rewire disk_backed() onto that (COOLJAPAN in-house-over-third-party preference) rather than raw memmap2 or inventing a new feature flag — needs a maintainer design call.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** disk_backed() currently silently allocates full in-memory storage regardless of file_path — a real functional gap for large-tensor/memory-constrained use, not cosmetic. NEEDS_CLARIFICATION on which mmap path to standardize on.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: hardware_accelerators_specialized.rs:63 — "TODO: Implement when PlatformDetectionResult and optimizer APIs are expanded"
  - **Approach:** NetworkAcceleratorEngine needs real interconnect/RDMA/topology detection (Ethernet vs InfiniBand, bandwidth probing) — no existing code path to extend anywhere in the workspace.
  - **Scope:** large
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Hardware-dependent subsystem needing OS-level syscalls not yet available in this pure-Rust workspace; reasonable to leave as documented no-op.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: hardware_accelerators_specialized.rs:239 — "TODO: Implement when SpecializedDetectionResult and accelerator APIs are expanded"
  - **Approach:** SpecializedAcceleratorEngine covers TPU/FPGA/NPU/quantum placeholders (20 leaf types) — genuine implementation means integrating proprietary non-Rust vendor SDKs, none referenced anywhere in this codebase.
  - **Scope:** oversized
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Essentially unbounded scope tied to proprietary vendor SDKs outside Pure-Rust policy; recommend keeping as explicit no-op indefinitely.

- [x] **COMPLETED** (wave3_deadcode_tensor): torsh-tensor: tests/tensor_tests.rs:202 — "TODO: Implement normal_ in-place function"
  - Ported a real `Tensor::normal_(mean, std)` (in-place, PyTorch-compatible) into `src/creation.rs` on top of the wave-1 process-global RNG (`with_rng`/`box_muller`/`sample_to_element`), replacing the only prior implementation which lived in uncompiled `src/ops.rs.backup` (now deleted) and used the banned direct `rand`/`rand_distr` crates. Rejects `requires_grad` tensors and non-finite/negative `std`, matching the other in-place ops. Test uncommented in tests/tensor_tests.rs; further coverage in tests/hardening_deadcode.rs.

- [x] **COMPLETED** (wave3_deadcode_tensor): torsh-tensor: tests/tensor_tests.rs:232 — "TODO: Implement multinomial sampling function"
  - Ported a real `Tensor::multinomial(&weights, num_samples, replacement)` into `src/creation.rs` via cumulative-distribution sampling on the wave-1 process-global RNG, replacing the only prior implementation which lived in uncompiled `src/ops.rs.backup` (now deleted). Validates 1-D shape, finite/non-negative weights, all-zero weights, and over-sampling without replacement; a last-positive-weight fallback guards the floating-point boundary case so a zero-weight category can never be selected. Test uncommented in tests/tensor_tests.rs; further coverage (including the boundary-fallback regression) in tests/hardening_deadcode.rs.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: math_ops.rs:55 — "TODO: scirs2_core::profiling module not available yet"
  - **Approach:** same finding as memory_pool.rs:72 — module now exists upstream but isn't reachable until the profiling feature is forwarded in Cargo.toml.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Same Cargo.toml fix as memory_pool.rs:72 unlocks this too.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: math_ops.rs:59 — "TODO: profile_section macro not available in scirs2_core yet"
  - **Approach:** swap commented profile_section! for scirs2_core::profiling::Timer::start(...) at the one guarded call site.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Same lock-contention caveat as memory_pool.rs; low blast radius (one call site).

- [ ] torsh-tensor: math_ops.rs:1220 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (add_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** currently delegates to self.add(other) whose "SIMD" fallback is dead code. scirs2_core::simd_ops::SimdUnifiedOps::simd_add(a,b) exists for f32/f64 — dispatch generically, closing the f64 SIMD gap.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Marginal gain for f32 (already fast); main win is f64/other-float coverage. Must preserve requires_grad/Operation::Add autograd bookkeeping.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: math_ops.rs:1230 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (mul_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** SimdUnifiedOps::simd_mul(a,b) exists for f32/f64.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** mul()'s f32 fast path returns via from_data WITHOUT setting requires_grad/operation (unlike add/sub) — pre-existing autograd-tracking gap worth fixing alongside.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: math_ops.rs:1240 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (sub_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** SimdUnifiedOps::simd_sub(a,b) exists for f32/f64.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** sub()'s fast path DOES correctly set requires_grad/Operation::Sub already — lower regression risk than mul.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: math_ops.rs:1250 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (div_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** SimdUnifiedOps::simd_div(a,b) exists for f32/f64.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** div()'s fast path also skips requires_grad/operation bookkeeping on early return (same gap as mul) — be careful not to bake this into any rewrite.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: cuda_backend/mod.rs:146 — "TODO(torsh-cuda-gemm): wire oxicuda-blas here"
  - **Approach:** oxicuda-blas is mature and published (0.4.0 resolved, matching sibling oxicuda-driver/launch/ptx already pinned) but CONFIRMED never referenced in root Cargo.toml. Add as optional workspace dep, wire into torsh-tensor's cuda feature, replace gemm()'s Err(Unsupported) with MatrixDesc/BlasHandle calls from existing raw u64 device pointers.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Pointer-marshaling across the raw-u64 ComputeBackend ABI into oxicuda-blas's typed descriptors is real glue work needing GPU hardware to validate.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: cuda_backend/mod.rs:165 — "TODO(torsh-cuda-dnn): wire oxicuda-dnn if GPU conv is ever needed"
  - **Approach:** oxicuda-dnn exists, published, unwired (same pattern as oxicuda-blas). Implement conv2d_forward() by constructing oxicuda-dnn's conv descriptors from existing raw pointer/shape/stride/padding args.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Same pointer-marshaling + hardware-validation caveat; conv descriptor setup (padding/stride/layout) is fiddly to get bit-exact.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_ops.rs:927 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (matmul_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** currently naive triple-nested-loop O(m·n·k), no blocking/SIMD/BLAS. scirs2_core::simd_ops::matmul::simd_matrix_multiply_f32/f64 usable with zero new dependency.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Real perf-relevant gap; requires ArrayView2 conversion + correct fallback for non-contiguous/broadcast shapes.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_ops.rs:937 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (sum_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** scirs2_core::simd_ops::SimdUnifiedOps::simd_sum(a) exists for f32/f64 — one-line swap after viewing as ArrayView1.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** SIMD reduction order differs from sequential fold — last-ULP differences possible, acceptable except for strict bit-reproducibility tests.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_ops.rs:954 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (mean_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** scirs2-stats::mean already used elsewhere in this crate (no new dep) — cleanest fix in this batch.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Narrower trait bounds (F: Float+Sum+Div+Display+SimdUnifiedOps) than current generic T — needs bound adjustment or TypeId dispatch shim; returns StatsResult needing mapping to TorshError.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_ops.rs:973 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (relu_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** Tensor::map is plain single-threaded collect with ZERO acceleration today. scirs2_core::ndarray_ext::elementwise::relu_simd is a direct match.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Real, uncontested gap; ReLU semantics unambiguous so low correctness risk.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_ops.rs:983 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (sigmoid_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** scirs2_core::ndarray_ext::elementwise::sigmoid_simd exists, claims better numerical stability for large |x| than the naive formula used today.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Low; watch tie-breaking/rounding differences in golden-value tests.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: advanced_ops.rs:995 — "TODO: Integrate with actual SciRS2 backend" (tanh_scirs2)
  - **Approach:** scirs2_core offers tanh_simd; current formula already correct, purely a perf upgrade.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Essentially none; lowest priority of the activation-function TODOs.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: algorithmic_optimizations.rs:757 — "TODO: Re-enable when tracing is added to dependencies"
  - **Approach:** tracing/tracing-subscriber already in root workspace Cargo.toml but not in torsh-tensor's own Cargo.toml; profiling=[] feature is unwired. Add tracing={workspace=true,optional=true}, change feature to profiling=["dep:tracing"], uncomment the trace! block.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Low — purely additive observability.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/data_science.rs:39 — "TODO: Implement Arrow serialization using arrow-rs crate"
  - **Approach:** arrow (59.0.0 resolved) already a feature-gated (serialize-arrow) dependency with everything needed (RecordBatch, FileWriter/StreamWriter). Map T:TensorElement to matching Arrow primitive array, flatten tensor.data(), build single-column RecordBatch with shape/dtype/requires_grad/version as Schema::metadata. Reachable code (dispatched from serialize/core.rs), not dead.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Mainly a schema-design risk (arbitrary tensor shapes/dtypes round-tripping, ideally pandas/pyarrow-interoperable) — API itself is present and stable.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/data_science.rs:89 — "TODO: Implement Parquet serialization using parquet-rs crate"
  - **Approach:** parquet (59.0.0) already a feature-gated dependency; ArrowWriter<W> with RecordBatchWriter impl. Same RecordBatch construction as the Arrow case, then ArrowWriter::try_new + write + close.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Shares schema-design risk with Arrow case; adds compression/encoding choices needing reasonable defaults.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/scientific.rs:94 — "TODO: Implement proper string metadata storage when HDF5 API is updated"
  - **Approach:** hdf5-types 0.8.1's VarLenUnicode (impl FromStr) already used successfully for READING elsewhere in this same file — write side is symmetric: new_attr::<VarLenUnicode>().create(key)?.write_scalar(&value.parse()?)?, matching the requires_grad/timestamp pattern already in this function.
  - **Scope:** small
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Attribute names must be valid identifiers; otherwise low risk.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/scientific.rs:210 — "TODO: Implement proper device storage when HDF5 string API is updated"
  - **Approach:** write-side mirror of read_device_from_attributes in the same file, which already reads via VarLenUnicode.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Debug format for DeviceType must keep matching the hand-rolled parser in read_device_from_attributes — a coupling to watch, not a blocker.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/scientific.rs:232 — "TODO: Implement proper dtype storage when HDF5 string API is updated"
  - **Approach:** same pattern as :210, write-side mirror of the existing dtype read.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** None beyond attribute-name validity.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/scientific.rs:236 — "TODO: Implement proper version storage when HDF5 string API is updated"
  - **Approach:** same pattern again, write-side mirror of existing version read.
  - **Scope:** trivial
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** None beyond attribute-name validity.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: serialize/ml_formats.rs:38 — "TODO: Implement ONNX serialization using onnx-rs crate"
  - **Approach:** PERMANENTLY blocked by explicit security policy — Cargo.toml has the onnx dep commented out with note "REMOVED: Unmaintained with security vulnerabilities (RUSTSEC-2024-0437, RUSTSEC-2023-0018)"; serialize-onnx is now a permanent no-op stub feature. Real fix requires either a from-scratch pure-Rust ONNX protobuf writer or a freshly-vetted replacement crate.
  - **Scope:** oversized (Status: tracked_external, permanent)
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** Reintroducing the old onnx crate reopens the RUSTSEC vulnerabilities; any future work needs a dependency security audit first, not a routine unblock.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: lib.rs:235 — "TODO: Conditional AutogradTensor trait implementation - torsh-autograd not yet available"
  - **Approach:** NEEDS_CLARIFICATION — torsh-autograd IS now a real workspace member and already depends on torsh-tensor, so implementing AutogradTensor FOR Tensor inside torsh-tensor would create a cyclic package dependency (Cargo will reject it). The correct fix is `impl AutogradTensor<T> for torsh_tensor::Tensor<T>` INSIDE torsh-autograd instead (orphan rule permits this, confirmed torsh-autograd doesn't implement it yet, only for its own Mock/OwnedTensor test types). This is a placement/design decision belonging to a different crate than this TODO names.
  - **Scope:** medium
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** A literal in-place fix (uncomment + add dep) fails to compile with a cyclic-dependency error — do not attempt the literal fix as written.

- [ ] torsh-tensor: hardware_accelerators.rs / hardware_accelerators_specialized.rs — cross-cutting note
  - **Approach:** several of the above (esp. items 3-5, 16-17) share the same `impl_placeholder_accelerator!`/`impl_detector_component!` macro-generated scaffolding pattern — worth tackling as one coordinated pass rather than piecemeal, since they share design questions (how much real hardware detection this crate wants to own vs. delegate to torsh-backend).
  - **Scope:** cross-cutting (spans items 3-5, 16-17)
  - **Prerequisites:** none
  - **Risk:** N/A — coordination note, not a standalone implementation task.
