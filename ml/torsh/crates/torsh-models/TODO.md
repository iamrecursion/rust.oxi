  - Averages losses from both directions for symmetric learning

- **`compute_cross_entropy` helper**:
  - Numerically stable cross-entropy computation
  - Uses built-in `log_softmax` for numerical stability
  - Extracts scalar values using `item()` method
  - Returns mean loss as scalar tensor

#### Comprehensive Test Coverage:
- **Added 6 new unit tests** for contrastive loss and position embeddings:
  1. `test_contrastive_loss_shape` - Verifies scalar loss output
  2. `test_contrastive_loss_perfect_match` - Tests with identical features
  3. `test_contrastive_loss_temperature_scaling` - Validates temperature effect
  4. `test_contrastive_loss_batch_size` - Tests various batch sizes (2, 4, 8, 16)
  5. `test_sinusoidal_position_embeddings_shape` - Validates embedding dimensions
  6. `test_sinusoidal_position_embeddings_properties` - Verifies sinusoidal properties
