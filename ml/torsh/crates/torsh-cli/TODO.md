## Technical Implementation Notes

### SciRS2 Policy Compliance ✅
- **CRITICAL**: All implementations MUST use SciRS2 ecosystem:
  - `scirs2_autograd::ndarray` for array operations (never direct ndarray)
  - `scirs2_core::random` for random number generation (never direct rand)
  - Full utilization of SciRS2's advanced features (SIMD, GPU, memory-efficient ops)

### Current Architecture Strengths ✅
- Modern async/await patterns with tokio
- Excellent error handling with anyhow and thiserror
- Comprehensive CLI argument parsing with clap 4.x
- Good separation of concerns with modular command structure
- Feature-gated dependencies for optional functionality
- Progress reporting and user feedback systems

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Start with Model Operations**: These are most critical for user adoption
2. **Focus on torsh-tensor Integration**: Most commands need real tensor operations
3. **Connect to Real Backends**: Replace mock implementations with actual functionality
4. **Maintain CLI Contract**: Keep current argument structure and behavior
5. **Add Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all commands

## Success Metrics

### Completion Targets
- **Phase 1**: 80% of core commands functional (model, basic training)
- **Phase 2**: 95% of advanced features implemented
- **Phase 3**: 100% production-ready with external integrations

### Quality Standards
- All commands must handle real ToRSh models and tensors
- Error handling should provide actionable user guidance
- Performance should be comparable to native PyTorch tools
- Memory usage should be optimized for large model operations

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all command argument parsing
- Integration tests with actual models and datasets
- Performance regression tests for critical operations
- CLI behavior tests for user experience validation

## Current Blockers and Dependencies

### High Priority Dependencies
1. **torsh-tensor stability**: Core tensor operations must be reliable
2. **torsh-autograd maturity**: Training commands depend on autograd functionality
3. **torsh-quantization completion**: Quantization commands need real implementation
4. **torsh-hub API**: Hub integration depends on service availability

### Technical Debt
- Replace all `tokio::time::sleep` mock implementations
- Implement real file I/O for model loading/saving
- Add proper error handling for malformed models
- Create comprehensive test coverage for all commands

This roadmap prioritizes **real functionality over mock implementations** while maintaining the excellent CLI architecture already established.

## Proposed follow-ups

- **Real model-I/O foundation needed before `quantize`/`convert`/`benchmark` wiring (surfaced 2026-07-03 by /nagare Phase 1 iteration 1, not actioned this run):** `commands/model/serialization.rs::serialize_tensor_data` currently fabricates random tensor data on save (`rng.gen_range`) instead of serializing real values, and `load_model` reconstructs metadata only — `TensorInfo` carries no data buffer. `commands/model/optimization.rs::load_torsh_model` similarly fabricates a random `Array2<f32>`. Any "wire quantize to torsh-quantization" work is blocked on building real tensor-data serialization first (add data buffers to `TensorInfo`/`SerializedTensor`, real save/load), then wiring to `torsh_quantization::{quantize_with_config, dequantize, calculate_quantization_metrics}` (the non-experimental, default-feature API — NOT `quantize_auto`/`ptq_pipeline`, which are gated behind an unused `experimental` feature and require a `Module` trait with no implementor). Recommend a dedicated future `/ultra` pass scoped to this foundation.
