/// Spectral normalization for weight matrices
///
/// Normalizes a weight matrix by its spectral norm (largest singular value)
/// to enforce Lipschitz constraint. Commonly used in GANs and other applications
/// requiring stable training.
///
/// ## Mathematical Definition
///
/// For a weight matrix W, spectral normalization computes:
/// ```text
/// W_sn = W / σ(W)
/// ```
/// where σ(W) is the spectral norm (largest singular value) of W.
///
/// ## Power Iteration Algorithm
///
/// The spectral norm is estimated using power iteration:
/// ```text
/// for i in 0..n_iterations:
///   v ← W^T u / ||W^T u||
///   u ← W v / ||W v||
/// σ(W) ≈ u^T W v
/// ```
///
/// ## Benefits
///
/// 1. **Lipschitz constraint**: ||W_sn|| ≤ 1
/// 2. **Training stability**: Prevents gradient explosion
/// 3. **GAN training**: Improves discriminator-generator balance
/// 4. **Regularization**: Implicit weight regularization effect
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `weight` - Weight matrix to normalize
/// * `n_power_iterations` - Number of power iterations for spectral norm estimation
/// * `eps` - Small value for numerical stability
///
/// # Returns
/// Spectrally normalized weight matrix

/// Weight standardization for improved training dynamics
///
/// Standardizes weights by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation
/// across output channels. This technique can improve training stability and
/// convergence speed, especially for batch-normalized networks.
///
/// ## Mathematical Definition
///
/// For a weight tensor W with shape \[out_channels, ...\], weight standardization computes:
/// ```text
/// W_std[i] = (W[i] - μ[i]) / (σ[i] + ε)
/// ```
/// where:
/// - `μ[i]` = mean(W\[i\]) across all dimensions except output channel
/// - `σ[i]` = std(W\[i\]) across all dimensions except output channel
/// - ε is a small constant for numerical stability
///
/// ## Benefits
///
/// 1. **Improved convergence**: Faster training convergence
/// 2. **Gradient flow**: Better gradient propagation
/// 3. **Batch norm compatibility**: Works well with batch normalization
/// 4. **Regularization**: Implicit regularization effect
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `weight` - Weight tensor with shape [out_channels, ...]
/// * `eps` - Small value for numerical stability
///
/// # Returns
/// Weight-standardized tensor with same shape as input
