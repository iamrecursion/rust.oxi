## Overview

TenfloweRS is a native Rust machine learning framework inspired by TensorFlow, designed to bring the power of deep learning to the Rust ecosystem. It leverages Rust's memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and excellent performance while maintaining compatibility with the broader ML ecosystem through ONNX support.

## Design Principles

TenfloweRS adapts TensorFlow's proven architecture to Rust's strengths:

1. **Memory Safety First**: All operations are memory-safe by design, eliminating segfaults and data races
2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: High-level APIs compile down to efficient machine code
3. **Explicit over Implicit**: Clear ownership and error handling following Rust conventions
4. **Modular Architecture**: Organized as a workspace of focused, reusable crates
5. **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows, macOS, and Linux with unified GPU abstraction
6. **Pure Rust**: No C/Fortran dependencies in the default build -- the entire stack is 100% Rust

## TensorFlow to TenfloweRS Mapping

| TensorFlow Concept | TenfloweRS Implementation |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `tf.Tensor` | `Tensor<T>` with static typing |
| `tf.Operation` | `Op` trait with registered kernels |
| `tf.Graph` | `Graph` struct with ownership semantics |
| `tf.Session` | `Session` trait for graph execution |
| `tf.GradientTape` | `GradientTape` for automatic differentiation |
| `tf.keras.Layer` | `Layer` trait with builder pattern |
| `tf.data.Dataset` | Iterator-based `Dataset` trait |
| `tf.device` | `Device` enum with placement control |

## Key Features

- **Dual Execution Modes**: Both eager execution (PyTorch-style) and static computation graphs (TensorFlow-style)
- **Pure Rust Implementation**: No C/C++ dependencies in the core, ensuring memory safety
- **GPU Support**: Cross-platform GPU acceleration via WGPU (Metal, Vulkan, DirectX)
- **Rust Scientific Stack**: Built on SciRS2 (scirs2-core / scirs2-autograd / scirs2-linalg / scirs2-numpy) for numerical computing
- **Python Bindings**: PyO3-based FFI crate (functional/alpha, `publish = false`) with 337 Rust tests + 55 Python (pytest) + 13 Python (integration_test.py) passing, including implicit PyTorch-style `.backward()`/`.grad()`/`optimizer.step()` autograd across every layer type and all 9 optimizers
- **ONNX Support**: Import and export models for cross-framework compatibility
- **Performance**: SIMD vectorization, optional BLAS integration, and parallel execution
- **150+ Research Domains**: From transformers and diffusion models to quantum ML and protein structure prediction
- **Production Ready**: 14,536+ tests passing, 2 known advisories (both upstream-blocked, none directly exploitable), comprehensive docs

## Project Status

**Current Version: 0.2.0** (Released 2026-07-13)

### v0.2.0 Quality Metrics

- **Tests:** 14,536+ passing, 39 skipped (`cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features`; 14,093 passing, 14 skipped with default features). 0.2.0's new tests are concentrated in the FFI and autograd crates, covering the rewired implicit-autograd layer/optimizer/loss wiring and the fixed gradient-correctness bugs.
- **Code:** 1,533 Rust files, ~686K SLoC (~824K total Rust lines)
- **Security:** 2 known advisories, both transitive and tracked (RUSTSEC-2024-0384 `instant` via `hdf5`; RUSTSEC-2024-0436 `paste` via `rav1e`/`parquet`/`metal` — none directly exploitable; fixes pending upstream). The prior RUSTSEC-2026-0204 `crossbeam-epoch` advisory is resolved this release (the lockfile now carries crossbeam-epoch >= 0.9.20). The pyo3 advisories (RUSTSEC-2026-0176/0177) were resolved last cycle via the pyo3 0.28 → 0.29 upgrade.
- **Clippy:** 0 warnings, 0 errors (verified)
- **Rustdoc:** Builds clean with `-D warnings` (verified)
- **Format:** `cargo fmt` clean (verified)

### Published Crates

| Crate | Tests | Status | Description |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| tenflowers-core | 1,174 (26 skipped) | Stable | Core tensor operations and GPU support |
| tenflowers-autograd | 575 (5 skipped) | Stable | Automatic differentiation engine |
| tenflowers-neural | 11,596 (8 skipped) | Stable | Neural network layers, models, and 150+ research domains |
| tenflowers-dataset | 698 | Stable | Data loading and preprocessing |
| tenflowers-ffi | 337 Rust + 55 Python (pytest) + 13 Python (integration_test.py) | Alpha/functional | Python bindings via PyO3 (`publish = false`, Python dev env required) |
| tenflowers | 156 | Stable | Umbrella crate re-exporting core/autograd/neural/dataset (not `tenflowers-ffi`, which is a separate sibling) |

All Rust counts are `--all-features`, freshly verified per-crate for 0.2.0 (from each crate's own README this pass). Workspace Rust-test total: 156 + 1,174 + 575 + 698 + 11,596 + 337 = 14,536 passing, 39 skipped (26 + 5 + 8). The FFI crate's 55 pytest + 13 integration_test.py Python tests are additional coverage not counted in that Rust total.

[dependencies]
tenflowers-core = "0.2.1"
tenflowers-neural = "0.2.1"
```

For GPU support:
```toml
[dependencies]
tenflowers-core = { version = "0.2.1", features = ["gpu"] }

## Quick Start

### Basic Tensor Operations
```rust,ignore
use tenflowers_core::{Tensor, Device, Context};
use tenflowers_autograd::GradientTape;

// Create a context for eager execution
let ctx = Context::new()?;

// Create tensors
let a = Tensor::<f32>::ones(&[2, 3]);
let b = Tensor::<f32>::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], &[2, 3])?;

// Operations execute immediately in eager mode
let c = a.add(&b)?;
let d = c.matmul(&b.transpose()?)?;

// Move to GPU (requires the "gpu" feature)
let gpu_tensor = a.to(Device::Gpu(0))?;

// Automatic differentiation: watch() wraps a Tensor in a TrackedTensor,
// pow() is tensor-tensor (not tensor-scalar), and gradient() takes slices
// of TrackedTensor for both targets and sources.
let tape = GradientTape::new();
let x = tape.watch(Tensor::<f32>::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0], &[3])?);
let y = x.pow(&x)?;
let grads = tape.gradient(&[y], &[x])?;
```

### Building a Neural Network
```rust,ignore
use tenflowers_core::Tensor;
use tenflowers_neural::{
    categorical_cross_entropy, layers::Layer, Adam, Conv2D, Dense, Dropout, Model, Sequential,
    Trainer,
};

// Define a small CNN + MLP head. Sequential::new() takes a Vec of boxed
// layers; layer constructors take positional args (in_channels, out_channels,
// kernel_size, stride, padding, use_bias) for Conv2D and
// (input_dim, output_dim, use_bias) for Dense -- there is no builder-style
// `.with_activation()` on these layer constructors.
let layers: Vec<Box<dyn Layer<f32>>> = vec![
    Box::new(Conv2D::new(1, 32, (3, 3), (1, 1), "valid".to_string(), true)),
    Box::new(Dense::new(128, 64, true)),
    Box::new(Dropout::new(0.5f32)),
    Box::new(Dense::new(64, 10, true)),
];
let mut model = Sequential::new(layers);

let mut optimizer: Adam<f32> = Adam::new(0.001);

// Training goes through Trainer::fit(), which takes the model, optimizer,
// an Iterator<Item = (Tensor<f32>, Tensor<f32>)> + Clone of training data, an
// optional validation iterator, the epoch count, and a loss function pointer.
// Honest caveat: today Trainer::fit's native-Rust loop drives the forward
// pass plus loss/metrics/callback tracking, but does not itself call a
// backward pass or optimizer.step() (see
// crates/tenflowers-neural/src/trainer/mod.rs's train_epoch), so weights are
// not yet updated by this convenience API. For real gradient-based training
// today in Rust, compose your own loop with tenflowers_autograd::GradientTape
// (see "Basic Tensor Operations" above); the Python FFI training loop below
// is the path 0.2.0 rewired to perform genuine tape-backed updates.
let mut trainer = Trainer::<f32>::new();
let train_data = std::iter::once((Tensor::<f32>::ones(&[4, 128]), Tensor::<f32>::ones(&[4, 10])));
trainer.fit(&mut model, &mut optimizer, train_data, None, 10, categorical_cross_entropy)?;
```

### Data Pipeline
```rust,ignore
use tenflowers_dataset::{DataLoaderBuilder, RandomSampler, TensorDataset};

// Create a dataset from tensors (two positional args, not a tuple)
let dataset = TensorDataset::new(images, labels);

// Shuffling is a Sampler passed to build(), not a chained method; batching
// and prefetching are configured on the builder before build().
let loader = DataLoaderBuilder::new(dataset)
    .batch_size(32)
    .prefetch_factor(2)
    .build(RandomSampler::new());

// Iterate through batches; iter() yields Result<BatchResult<T>>.
for batch_result in loader.iter() {
    let batch = batch_result?;
    // Training step
}
```

### Python: PyTorch-style Training

The headline feature of v0.2.0 is a real, tape-backed implicit-autograd training
loop from Python, in the same shape PyTorch users already know:

```python
import numpy as np
import tenflowers as tf

# tensor_from_numpy requires a float32 numpy array
X = np.random.uniform(-1.0, 1.0, size=(16, 4)).astype(np.float32)
y = np.random.uniform(-1.0, 1.0, size=(16, 1)).astype(np.float32)
x_tensor = tf.tensor_from_numpy(X)
y_tensor = tf.tensor_from_numpy(y)

layer = tf.PyDense(4, 1, activation=None)
for param in layer.parameters():
    param.set_requires_grad(True)

optimizer = tf.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

for step in range(50):
    y_pred = layer.forward(x_tensor)
    loss = tf.mse_loss(y_pred, y_tensor)

    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step(layer)
    optimizer.zero_grad(layer)

print(f"final loss: {float(tf.tensor_to_numpy(loss)[()]):.6f}")
```

This same `.backward()` / `optimizer.step()` / `optimizer.zero_grad()` pattern
works for `PySequential` models and every other layer type listed above,
subject to the two narrow gaps noted in the v0.2.0 roadmap entry below. See
`crates/tenflowers-ffi/tests/test_training_convergence.py` for the full
end-to-end tests (Dense, a 3-layer Sequential MLP, and Conv2D) that assert
loss actually decreases, not just that `.backward()` runs without raising.

## Roadmap

### v0.2.0 (Released 2026-07-13)
- FFI: complete rewire of the implicit, PyTorch-style autograd system. Every layer type now has real backward support wired into the tape -- Dense, Conv1D/2D/3D and pooling, Embedding/EmbeddingBag, BatchNorm1d/LayerNorm/GroupNorm/InstanceNorm1d, MultiheadAttention, TransformerEncoderLayer/DecoderLayer, and LSTM/GRU/RNN and their cells -- versus only a minimal Dense/Sequential/MSE path previously
- FFI: all 9 optimizers (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, AdamW, AdaBelief, RAdam, Nadam, AdaGrad, AdaDelta) now perform real gradient-based parameter updates, reading `.grad()` and writing back to parameters; every loss function is genuinely backward-connected to the tape
- Two narrow, documented gaps remain: Conv1D/2D/3D and MaxPool2D/AvgPool2D tape recording only fires for unit dilation, `groups==1`, and no explicit padding (other configurations still compute a correct forward value but skip gradient recording); `EmbeddingBag`'s `mode="max"` is not tape-wired (`sum`/`mean` are)
- New `tests/test_training_convergence.py`: three end-to-end tests (`test_dense_layer_training_converges`, `test_sequential_mlp_training_converges`, `test_conv2d_training_converges`) that assert loss actually decreases across real training loops, not just that `.backward()` runs without raising
- Autograd correctness fixes: Softmax/LogSoftmax backward were computing wrong gradients; BatchNorm eval-mode `grad_gamma`/`grad_beta` were hardcoded to zero; LayerNorm/GroupNorm backward had a gamma-before-reduction bug (up to 760% relative error for non-uniform gamma in GroupNorm); Slice/Gather backward were stubs and now produce real gradients; a row-major-vs-Fortran-order stride bug in `slice_with_stride` was silently producing wrong elements for non-square/non-1D sliced arrays; and two tape-registry lifecycle bugs (a dropped `PyParameter` reusing an allocation address, and `mark_leaf_param` breaking on a second `forward()` without an intervening `backward()`) that could silently drop a parameter's gradient
- Security: resolved RUSTSEC-2026-0204 (`crossbeam-epoch`, via the lockfile picking up >= 0.9.20); 2 known transitive advisories remain tracked (`instant`, `paste` — see Security section of CHANGELOG.md)
- 14,536+ tests, 39 skipped, 0 clippy warnings, 0 rustdoc warnings, 2 known transitive advisories (upstream-blocked, none directly exploitable)

### v0.1.2 (Released 2026-07-08)
- Meta-crate: `error`, `logging`, `utils`, `platform`, `version_check` modules
- FFI: session-based `PyProfiler` / `PyProfileReport` profiling API; new `implicit_autograd` module giving `PyTensor` PyTorch-style eager `.backward()`/`.grad()` on top of the existing `GradientTape` engine; standalone `gradient_parity` finite-difference gradient checker
- Dataset: `hdf5_advanced` and `parquet_advanced` modules with chunked/filtered readers; from-scratch pure-Rust `formats::blosc` Blosc decoder (all 5 inner codecs + byte/bit-shuffle) wired into Zarr; real Symphonia-backed `formats::audio` decoding (WAV/MP3/FLAC); `formats::tfrecord_advanced` `SequenceExample` reader with real masked-CRC32 verification; new GPU image transforms (affine/perspective/elastic/histogram-equalize)
- Core: real ONNX protobuf import/export (`onnx_interop`) for the core graph representation, covering `Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Relu/Sigmoid/Tanh/MatMul/Reshape/Transpose/Identity/Concat/Softmax/Flatten/Gemm`; `session::SessionConfig::enable_graph_optimization` (default on) wires constant-folding/CSE/algebraic-simplification/strength-reduction/DCE/scheduling into real `Session` execution; N-D (`[N,d1,d2,...]`) segment reductions for all of `segment_max/min/prod/any/all`; GPU-einsum batched-matmul/transpose/diagonal/outer/trace now correctly delegate to CPU instead of honest-erroring; real `device::GpuAdapterCapabilities` from the live `wgpu::Adapter` (no more fabricated vendor/capability guessing); real LAPACK-backed `ops::lapack_f64` (inverse/determinant/SVD/solve)
- CUDA/ROCm/OpenCL feature flags documented with inline explanations
- Dependencies: scirs2 0.6.0, oxicode 0.2.4, oxiarc-archive 0.3.4, oxifft 0.3.2, wgpu 30.0, pyo3 0.29, arrow/parquet 59.0; new oxiarc-lz4/oxiarc-deflate/oxiarc-snappy (Blosc inner codecs)
- Lock-poisoning `.expect()` calls replaced with `Result` propagation across `CheckpointManager`, `CrossDatacenterReplicator`, and `DeterministicContext`
- NCCL/Gloo/MPI/thread collective backends return honest `NotImplemented` errors (previously fabricated/simulated data); `DataParallelTrainer::train_step` now computes real gradients via finite differences instead of simulating the backward pass
- Two real GPU-path crash bugs fixed (`Tensor::from_storage` panic on GPU storage; hardcoded `Device::Gpu(0)` regardless of actual buffer device); a Miri-confirmed alignment UB fixed in `tenflowers-dataset`'s `MemoryPool`
- Security: resolved RUSTSEC-2026-0176/0177 (pyo3, via the 0.29 upgrade); 3 new/tracked transitive advisories (crossbeam-epoch, instant, paste — see Security section of CHANGELOG.md)
- 14,289+ tests, 39 skipped, 0 clippy warnings, 0 rustdoc warnings, 3 known transitive advisories (upstream-blocked, none directly exploitable)

### v0.1.1 (Released 2026-04-24)
- Core tensor operations and autograd
- 150+ neural network research domains
- GPU support via WGPU
- Python bindings via PyO3
- 13,484 tests, 41 skipped, 0 warnings, 0 vulnerabilities

### v0.3.0 (Planned)
- Expanded GPU kernel coverage (native GPU compute for currently CPU-fallback ops)
- Performance benchmarking suite with CI gates
- Wider ONNX operator coverage beyond the current core subset; TensorFlow SavedModel protobuf import
- Multi-GPU orchestration improvements; real NCCL/Gloo/MPI collective-communications backend
- Zarr Blosc *encoder* (decoder landed in 0.1.2)
- Wider tape-recording coverage for Conv1D/2D/3D/pooling (dilated, grouped, and explicitly-padded configurations) and `EmbeddingBag(mode="max")`
- API stability improvements toward 1.0

### v1.0.0 (Future)
- Stable public API with semantic versioning guarantees
- Comprehensive ONNX compatibility
- Production deployment tooling
- WASM compilation target
