//! Loss functions module for TenfloweRS FFI
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive loss function implementations for neural network training,
//! including MSE, CrossEntropy, BCE, and other common loss functions.
//!
//! # Autograd
//!
//! Every loss below (including [`mse_loss`]) is computed entirely through
//! tape-aware operations — [`PyTensor::sub`]/[`PyTensor::mul`]/[`PyTensor::add`]/
//! [`PyTensor::div`] and [`crate::math_ops::sum`]/[`crate::math_ops::mean`] —
//! rather than pulling tensors down to a raw `Vec<f32>`, looping, and
//! rebuilding a `PyTensor` with `Tensor::from_vec`. The latter has no
//! relationship to [`crate::implicit_autograd`]'s tape, so a `PyTensor`
//! produced that way can never be the target of a `.backward()` call (see
//! `crate::implicit_autograd::run_backward`, which requires the tensor to be
//! looked up in the tape's tracked-tensor registry).
//!
//! ## The `log`/`abs`/`clamp`/`sqrt` gap, and how this module closes it
//!
//! [`crate::implicit_autograd::UnaryOpKind`] (the tag enum
//! [`crate::implicit_autograd::record_and_link_unary`] dispatches on) only
//! has variants for `Relu`/`Sigmoid`/`Tanh`/`Softmax`/`Transpose`/`Reshape`/
//! `Slice`/`Sum`/`Mean` today. `Log`/`Abs`/`Clamp` do **not** have a variant
//! there yet, even though `tenflowers_autograd::TrackedTensor` already has
//! working `log`/`abs`/`clamp` methods with real, tested backward
//! implementations (`process_log_backward`/`process_abs_backward`/
//! `process_clamp_backward` in
//! `tenflowers-autograd/src/tape/gradient_computation/activation_ops.rs`) —
//! the FFI-layer `UnaryOpKind` enum and its `record_and_link_unary` match
//! arms were simply never updated to expose them. `sqrt` has no
//! `TrackedTensor` method or `Operation` variant at all yet.
//!
//! Every binary-cross-entropy/cross-entropy/KL/L1/smooth-L1/cosine loss below
//! needs at least one of these four operations. Rather than duplicate
//! `implicit_autograd/mod.rs`'s tape-recording machinery in this file (which
//! would create two independent sources of truth for how an operation gets
//! linked onto the tape), this module instead expresses `log`/`abs`/`clamp`/
//! `sqrt` **compositionally**, purely in terms of the tape kinds that
//! already exist end-to-end (`Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Add`, `Sum`, `Mean`):
//!
//! * `log(x)`: recorded as `Div(x, x_detached)`, where `x_detached` is an
//!   untracked constant copy of `x`'s own values. `Div`'s real backward is
//!   `grad_lhs = grad_output / rhs`, so gradient flowing back through the
//!   `lhs` (`x`) slot is `grad_output / x` — exactly `d(log(x))/dx`. The
//!   `rhs` slot must be untracked (never `mark_leaf`'d, never the `result` of
//!   another tracked op), or `Div`'s *other* backward formula
//!   (`grad_rhs = -grad_output * lhs / rhs²`) would also feed a second,
//!   spurious gradient contribution back into `x` through that slot.
//! * `abs(x)`: recorded as `Mul(x, sign(x)_detached)`. `Mul`'s backward is
//!   `grad_lhs = grad_output * rhs`, giving `grad_output * sign(x)` —
//!   exactly `d(|x|)/dx` (including the `sign(0) := 0` convention
//!   `process_abs_backward` itself documents and uses, which this
//!   composition reproduces exactly because `0 * anything = 0`, never a
//!   `0/0` or division-by-zero `NaN`/`Inf` the way a naive `Div`-based
//!   `x / sign(x)` composition would at `x == 0`).
//! * `clamp(x, lo, hi)`: recorded as `Mul(x, in_range_mask_detached)`, where
//!   `in_range_mask` is `1.0` where `lo <= x <= hi` and `0.0` elsewhere —
//!   exactly the gate `process_clamp_backward` itself computes and applies.
//! * `sqrt(x)`: recorded as `Div(x, two_sqrt_x_detached)`, where
//!   `two_sqrt_x_detached = 2 * sqrt(x)` (detached). `grad_lhs =
//!   grad_output / (2 * sqrt(x))` — exactly `d(sqrt(x))/dx`.
//!
//! In every case above, the **forward value** returned to Python is always
//! computed via the real, already-stable `tenflowers_core::ops::{log, abs,
//! clamp, sqrt}` kernels — never via whatever the proxy `Div`/`Mul` tape node
//! happens to compute internally (which is discarded; see
//! [`link_unary_via_binary_proxy`]'s doc for why this split is sound). This
//! is the same "compute the forward value with the existing stable math, but
//! separately establish the correct tape edge" idea
//! [`crate::implicit_autograd::record_and_link_binary`]/
//! [`record_and_link_unary`] already use for a non-tracked constant operand,
//! just applied one level up.
//!
//! Composing an entire loss formula out of elementary pieces that each have
//! a correct *local* gradient edge is sufficient for the *whole* expression's
//! gradient to come out correct, with no per-function hand-derivation of
//! product/chain-rule terms needed: every intermediate `PyTensor` on the path
//! (e.g. `log(t_c)` inside [`kl_div_loss`]) is itself tape-linked back to
//! its own inputs, so [`crate::implicit_autograd::run_backward`]'s ordinary
//! reverse-mode traversal accumulates every contribution automatically,
//! exactly as it does for any other multi-step computation.
//!
//! ## Coordination flag for whoever owns `implicit_autograd/mod.rs` next
//!
//! The compositional approach above is deliberately *not* a permanent
//! substitute for real `UnaryOpKind::{Log, Abs, Clamp}` variants (and a real
//! `sqrt` `Operation`/`TrackedTensor` method) — it exists because this file
//! is scoped to not modify `implicit_autograd/mod.rs`, `tensor_ops.rs`, or any
//! other `neural/*.rs` file. Once `Log`/`Abs`/`Clamp` are added to
//! `UnaryOpKind` (the `TrackedTensor` and `Operation` sides already exist —
//! see the module-level doc above) and a `sqrt` `Operation`/`TrackedTensor`
//! method + `UnaryOpKind::Sqrt` variant are added, every helper in this file
//! ([`tape_log`], [`tape_abs`], [`tape_clamp`], [`tape_sqrt`]) can be
//! simplified to a direct `record_and_link_unary` call, dropping the
//! `Div`/`Mul`-proxy indirection — the loss functions that call them would
//! not need to change at all.

/// # Why the proxy node's own forward value is never read (and therefore

/// (which reads `lhs`/`rhs`'s *own* stored values from the tape by id, not
/// anything routed through `result`) and is otherwise discarded:
/// `record_and_link_binary` only extracts the recorded node's *identity* via
/// `register_tracked(result, Arc::new(recorded))`, which maps
/// `tensor_key(result)` — the address of `result`'s own, separately
/// constructed `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` — to that node for future graph traversal.
/// Nothing ever compares `recorded`'s internal forward value against

/// instead of an error (which would have been easier to catch). Verified via

/// This helper sidesteps the problem at its root by never letting a

/// derivative**, never against another proxy's output. Multiple
/// contributions are then combined with plain, tape-aware `Add`, whose
/// backward reads neither operand's value (see this module's top-level doc

/// Sum a `[batch_size, feature_size]` tensor over its second axis, giving a

///
/// # Why this exists (two real upstream bugs, found in sequence)
///
/// [`crate::math_ops::sum`] (and `mean`) *is* tape-aware (see this module's
/// top-level doc) — but its backward, for **any** axis-specific (not full,
/// not already-scalar) reduction whose surviving dimension has size `>= 2`,
/// was found (via finite-difference testing during development, on both
/// [`cross_entropy`] and [`cosine_embedding_loss`]) to silently corrupt the
/// gradient: batch element `0` receives the correct value, but every other
/// batch element incorrectly receives batch element `0`'s value too, instead
/// of its own. Root cause (confirmed by direct inspection, entirely outside
/// this crate and this file): `tenflowers-autograd`'s
/// `crates/tenflowers-autograd/src/tape/gradient_computation/tensor_ops.rs`,
/// function `broadcast_gradient_to_shape` (called by `Operation::Sum`'s
/// backward) only has correct handling for three cases — an exact shape
/// match, a true 0-d scalar, and a `[1]`-shaped gradient — and falls through
/// to an "ultimate fallback" for anything else that reads *only the first
/// element* of the incoming gradient and broadcasts that single scalar
/// uniformly across the *entire* output shape, discarding every other batch
/// element's own gradient value.
///
/// An earlier version of this helper worked around that by summing via
/// [`PyTensor::slice`] (one column at a time) + [`PyTensor::add`] instead of
/// `Sum`. That approach hit a **second**, independent upstream bug:
/// `tenflowers-core`'s `slice_with_stride` (the kernel `PyTensor::slice`
/// calls into) computes its linear-index stride left-to-right (`dim 0` gets
/// stride `1`, `dim 1` gets stride `shape[0]`, ...) — genuine Fortran/
/// column-major order — while `Tensor::from_vec`'s actual backing storage
/// (`ArrayD::from_shape_vec`) and this crate's own `StridedLayout` are both
/// correctly row-major (C-order, last dim stride `1`). The mismatch means
/// `.slice(...)` silently returns data from the *wrong* elements entirely
/// for any `>=2`-D tensor slice that isn't the last axis — confirmed via a
/// standalone reproduction matching this exact `[2,3]` shape (`.slice([(0,
/// 1, None)])`, intended as "row 0", returned `[data[0], data[2], data[4]]`
/// instead of `[data[0], data[1], data[2]]`).
///
/// Both of these are bugs in `tenflowers-core`/`tenflowers-autograd`, not in
/// this file — but per this file's ownership scope, neither of those crates
/// is something this rewrite may modify. This helper works around *both* by
/// building the reduction from [`PyTensor::matmul`] against a `[feature_size,
/// 1]` all-ones vector (`sum(x, axis=1) == x @ ones` is a standard linear-
/// algebra identity) followed by [`crate::tensor_ops::reshape`] to drop the
