//! Implicit (PyTorch-style) eager automatic differentiation.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! TenfloweRS already has a fully working *explicit* tape API
//! ([`tenflowers_autograd::GradientTape`], exposed to Python as
//! [`crate::neural::gradient_tape::PyGradientTape`]): a user calls
//! `tape.watch(x)`, performs operations on the returned
//! [`tenflowers_autograd::TrackedTensor`], and then calls `tape.gradient(y, x)`
//! on the *same* tape object.
//!
//! PyTorch-style eager autograd has no explicit tape in user code at all:
//!
//! ```python
//! x.set_requires_grad(True)
//! y = x * x
//! y.backward()
//! g = x.grad()
//! ```
//!
//! Something has to *implicitly* track the computation graph from the moment
//! `requires_grad=True` starts, without the user ever constructing a
//! `GradientTape` themselves. This module provides that missing piece by
//! layering a thread-local, auto-activating `GradientTape` underneath
//! [`crate::tensor_ops::PyTensor`], and reusing the exact same
//! `TrackedTensor` op-recording + `GradientTape::gradient` backward-pass
//! machinery that the explicit `PyGradientTape` already relies on. No new
//! gradient math is introduced anywhere in this module — it only decides
//! *when* to call into the existing, tested autodiff engine.
//!
//! ## Why a side-table instead of a `PyTensor` field
//!
//! [`crate::tensor_ops::PyTensor`] is constructed via `PyTensor { tensor,
//! requires_grad, is_pinned }` struct literals at ~190 call sites across this
//! crate. Adding a required field to the struct would force updating every
//! one of those literals purely for field-list completeness, which is an
//! enormous, unrelated blast radius for this feature and directly conflicts
//! with the instruction to avoid touching code that isn't part of the task.
//!
//! Instead, every piece of implicit-autograd state is keyed by a
//! [`PyTensor`]'s *stable identity* — the address of its `Arc<Tensor<f32>>`
//! allocation (see [`tensor_key`]) — and stored in thread-local side-tables.
//! `PyTensor` itself is completely unmodified by this module; only a handful
//! of new methods are added to it (in `tensor_ops.rs`) that delegate here.
//!
//! ### The address-reuse hazard, and how [`IDENTITY_ANCHORS`] closes it
//!
//! An `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` address is only a *safe* identity key for as long as
//! something keeps that exact `Arc` allocation alive. Once every strong
//! reference to it is dropped (e.g. the Python tensor object is garbage
//! collected), the allocator is free to reuse that address for a completely
//! unrelated `Arc` allocated later — including another `PyTensor`'s. Without
//! precaution, a side-table keyed purely by address would then confuse the
//! new, unrelated tensor for the old one (this was caught during development
//! via exactly this scenario: a `requires_grad=False` tensor's `.grad()`
//! spuriously returned a stale gradient that belonged to an earlier,
//! already-freed tensor whose `Arc` address had been reused).
//!
//! [`IDENTITY_ANCHORS`] closes this hole: whenever a key is inserted into
//! [`TRACKED_REGISTRY`], [`LEAVES`], or [`GRAD_STORE`], a strong
//! `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` clone is also stashed in `IDENTITY_ANCHORS` under that
//! same key, guaranteeing the address cannot be freed (and therefore cannot
//! be reused for a different tensor) for as long as *any* table still
//! references that key. The anchor for a given key is only ever removed once
//! every table that could reference it no longer does.
//!
//! ### Explicit-key parameter identities need no anchoring
//!
//! [`crate::neural::layers::PyParameter`] introduces a *second* kind of
//! identity into these same side-tables: instead of a [`tensor_key`] derived
//! from a `PyTensor`'s own `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` address, a parameter's `id` is
//! the address of the `Arc<RwLock<Tensor<f32>>>` allocation backing its
//! *value cell* — an address that a training loop deliberately keeps calling
//! back into the *same* leaf under, forward pass after forward pass, even as
//! the cell's contents are replaced in place by an optimizer step (see that
//! struct's doc for why a plain `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` cannot support this).
//! [`mark_leaf_param`] and [`get_grad_by_id`] operate on this kind of key
//! directly, alongside [`clear_grad_by_id`] for clearing it.
//!
//! Crucially, this explicit-key path deliberately does **not** populate
//! [`IDENTITY_ANCHORS`] the way the [`tensor_key`]-derived path does (see
//! [`register_tracked_by_key`]). The address-reuse hazard above exists
//! because a `tensor_key` address becomes unsafe to reuse as a table key the
//! moment its originating `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` is dropped and something else
//! might get allocated at the same address — so this module has to keep that
//! `Arc` alive itself. A `PyParameter`'s `id` has no such problem *while the
//! parameter is alive*: its `Arc<RwLock<Tensor<f32>>>` allocation is kept
//! alive directly by the `PyParameter` Python object's own lifetime for as
//! long as it exists, completely independent of anything this module
//! tracks. There is simply nothing for `IDENTITY_ANCHORS` to usefully do for
//! this kind of key while its owner is alive — anchoring it would only pin a
//! redundant clone of an allocation that was never at risk of being freed
//! out from under its key.
//!
//! That "while alive" qualifier matters: unlike [`tensor_key`] entries
//! (whose lifetime *in these tables* is governed entirely by this module,
//! via `IDENTITY_ANCHORS`), a `PyParameter`'s `id` genuinely does stop being
//! safe once the parameter itself is dropped — the `RwLock` allocation truly
//! is freed at that point, and the allocator can legitimately hand that same
//! address to a later, unrelated `PyParameter`. Two independent tables can
//! each go stale this way, for two different reasons:
//!
//! * [`GRAD_STORE`] is deliberately never cleared by [`run_backward`] (so
//!   `.grad()` survives after the graph is freed, mirroring PyTorch), so a
//!   dropped parameter's now-stale `GRAD_STORE` entry could otherwise be
//!   spuriously "inherited" by a later, address-colliding parameter.
//! * [`TRACKED_REGISTRY`]/[`LEAVES`] are only cleared by a successful
//!   [`run_backward`] call — which a legitimate forward-only computation
//!   (one whose result is simply never backpropagated through) never
//!   triggers. A parameter [`mark_leaf_param`]'d and then dropped without an
//!   intervening `run_backward` leaves its `id` behind in both tables. Worse
//!   than `GRAD_STORE`'s hazard, this one is not merely "spurious data read
//!   back" but a silent tracking failure: [`mark_leaf_param`]'s own
//!   idempotency check (`TRACKED_REGISTRY.contains_key(&explicit_key)`)
//!   cannot distinguish that stale entry from "this exact parameter was
//!   already marked earlier this cycle", so a later, address-colliding
//!   parameter's very first `mark_leaf_param` call takes the early-return
//!   branch and is silently never watched on the tape at all — confirmed
//!   reproducible via
//!   [`tests::dropped_untracked_backward_param_does_not_poison_tracked_registry_on_address_reuse`].
//!
//! Rather than anchoring (which would require keeping the very allocation
//! alive that `Drop` is trying to free — a contradiction), `PyParameter`'s
//! `Drop` impl (in `layers.rs`) proactively calls [`unregister_param_id`] on
//! its own `id` as the parameter goes away — scrubbing `TRACKED_REGISTRY`,
//! `LEAVES`, *and* `GRAD_STORE` together — closing all three holes at the
//! moment they actually open rather than preventing them from ever opening.
//! This is sound because a `PyParameter`'s `id` is exclusively owned —
//! `PyParameter` does not implement `Clone`, so exactly one live object ever
//! owns a given `id`, and its `Drop` can never race with a different,
//! still-alive parameter that shares that `id`.
//!
//! ([`PyParameter::zero_grad`](crate::neural::layers::PyParameter::zero_grad)
//! — an explicit, user-requested clear of just the accumulated gradient in
//! the *middle* of a still-alive parameter's lifetime — deliberately keeps
//! calling only [`clear_grad_by_id`], not [`unregister_param_id`]: it must
//! not un-track a parameter that is still legitimately in use.)
//!
//! ## Components
//!
//! * [`IMPLICIT_TAPE`] — one [`GradientTape`] per thread, created lazily and
//!   reused for the life of the thread. It auto-activates: nothing must be
//!   explicitly "started", it simply exists and is always recording.
//! * [`TRACKED_REGISTRY`] — maps a tensor's stable identity to the
//!   [`TrackedTensor<f32>`] that represents it on the implicit tape. Populated
//!   by [`mark_leaf`] / [`mark_leaf_param`] (for tensors and parameters with
//!   `requires_grad=True`) and by [`record_and_link_binary`] /
//!   [`record_and_link_unary`] (for the outputs of tracked operations).
//! * [`LEAVES`] — the set of tensors (and parameter snapshots) that became
//!   tracked *directly* via `set_requires_grad(True)` or
//!   [`mark_leaf_param`] (as opposed to becoming tracked because an input was
//!   tracked). These are exactly the tensors `.backward()` differentiates
//!   with respect to, mirroring PyTorch's notion of a "leaf".
//! * [`GRAD_STORE`] — the `.grad` storage itself: after `.backward()` runs,
//!   each leaf's computed gradient is stored here keyed by the leaf's stable
//!   identity, so `PyTensor::grad()` / [`get_grad_by_id`] can look it up
//!   later.
//! * [`IDENTITY_ANCHORS`] — see above; keeps a [`tensor_key`]'s
//!   `Arc<Tensor<f32>>` allocation alive (and therefore its address
//!   un-reusable) for exactly as long as any of the three tables above still
//!   references that key. Not populated for [`crate::neural::layers::PyParameter`]
//!   explicit-key entries — see "Explicit-key parameter identities" above.
//!
//! ## Generic operation hook
//!
//! [`record_and_link_binary`] and [`record_and_link_unary`] are dispatched on
//! a small [`BinaryOpKind`] / [`UnaryOpKind`] tag rather than being one
//! function per named op. Any binary op that has a `TrackedTensor` method
//! (`add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `pow`, `matmul`, ...) can be wired in by
//! adding one match arm and one call site — nothing about the hook itself is
//! specific to `add`/`mul`/`matmul` by name.
//!
//! Three more hooks follow the same "tag enum + dispatch" shape for
//! operations that do not fit the binary/unary arity:
//!
//! * [`record_and_link_ternary`] — up to three *differentiable* operands
//!   (input, weight/gamma, optional bias/beta), for `TrackedTensor` methods
//!   like `conv1d`/`conv2d`/`conv3d`/`layer_norm`/`group_norm`/
//!   `instance_norm`. [`TernaryOpKind::BatchNorm`] is a partial exception:
//!   `TrackedTensor::batch_norm` needs *five* tracked-tensor operands, but
//!   two of them (`running_mean`/`running_var`) are forward-only statistics
//!   that are read for their values but never differentiated through (see
//!   that variant's own doc) — structurally the same "must be present on the
//!   tape, must never be a leaf" treatment [`record_and_link_binary`] already
//!   gives a constant operand, just applied to two extra fixed-role tensors
//!   instead of `lhs`/`rhs` themselves.
//! * [`record_and_link_variadic`] — an arbitrary number of *equal-role*
//!   operands, for `TrackedTensor::concat`/`TrackedTensor::stack`, which are
//!   associated functions taking a `&[&TrackedTensor<T>]` slice rather than
//!   distinguishing e.g. a "primary" operand from the rest.
//! * [`record_and_link_gather`] — `TrackedTensor::gather`'s `indices`
//!   argument is a raw `Tensor<i32>`, never a [`PyTensor`]/`TrackedTensor` at
//!   all, so it cannot be tracked or become a leaf; only `input`'s tracked
//!   status matters, which does not fit any of the tag-enum hooks above.

///   (this exact `PyTensor` snapshot) is subsequently passed as an operand to
///   one of those functions — which is exactly what happens next in a real
///   `forward()`, e.g. `weight_snapshot.matmul(&input)` — the lookup has no
///   way to know about `explicit_key` at all; it can only ever find the
///   entry via `tensor_key(transient)`. Without this second registration,
///   every operation performed directly on `transient` would silently be
///   treated as untracked.
/// * `explicit_key` is what must end up owning the [`LEAVES`] entry (and,
