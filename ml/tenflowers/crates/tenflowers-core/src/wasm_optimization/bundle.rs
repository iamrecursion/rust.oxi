//! WASM bundle size optimization and configuration
//!
//! # Honest limitation
//!
//! `WasmBundleOptimizer` stores optimization *preferences*
//! (`WasmOptimizationConfig`, `CodeSplittingConfig`, `TreeShakingConfig`,
//! `CompressionConfig`) that a caller can use to describe how they *want* a
//! WASM build to be optimized. It does not, and currently cannot, measure any
//! real savings: nothing in this type, nor anywhere else in
//! `wasm_optimization::*`, ever receives or parses an actual compiled `.wasm`
//! binary. An earlier version of this file fabricated "bytes saved" reports
//! from hardcoded per-category constants (e.g. "8 branch optimizations, 25
//! bytes saved each") that never varied with any real input -- the same
//! numbers were returned regardless of what code, if any, was being compiled.
//! That has been removed rather than relabeled, because renaming fields does
//! not turn constant, input-independent numbers into genuine estimates.
//! `WasmBundleOptimizer::optimize_for_edge` and
//! `WasmBundleOptimizer::optimize_for_minimal_size` now return an honest
//! `Err` explaining this instead of a fabricated report. See the doc comments
//! on those functions, and on `WasmBundleOptimizer::detect_simd_support`,
//! for what real support would require.
