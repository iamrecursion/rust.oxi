**Version:** 0.1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-20
**Status:** Active Planning Document

## Executive Summary

This document defines the prioritized roadmap for expanding GPU kernel coverage in TenfloweRS Core. Current GPU coverage is partial, with many operations falling back to CPU execution. This roadmap establishes clear priorities based on performance impact, usage frequency, and implementation complexity.

## Current GPU Kernel Coverage

### ✅ Implemented (High-Quality)
- Basic arithmetic: `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`
- Matrix multiplication: `matmul`, `batch_matmul` (WGSL compute shaders)
- Basic reductions: `sum` (partial)
- Memory operations: allocation, deallocation, transfer

### ⚠️ Partial/CPU Fallback
- Advanced reductions: `mean`, `min`, `max`, `argmin`, `argmax`
- Cumulative operations: `cumsum`, `cumprod`
- Statistical operations: `variance`, `std`, `median`
- Segment reductions: `segment_sum`, `segment_mean`
- Boolean reductions: `all`, `any`

### ❌ CPU-Only (No GPU Implementation)
- Topk operations
- Advanced sorting operations
- Sparse operations
- Complex number operations
- Some activation functions (GELU variants, Mish, etc.)
