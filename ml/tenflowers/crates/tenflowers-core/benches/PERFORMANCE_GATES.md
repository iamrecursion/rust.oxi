# Dispatch Registry Performance Gates

This document defines the performance gates (thresholds) for the dispatch registry system and explains how to interpret benchmark results.

## Executive Summary

The dispatch registry system is designed to have minimal overhead while providing flexible backend dispatch capabilities. Performance gates ensure that:

1. **Dispatch overhead stays below acceptable thresholds** across all tensor sizes
2. **Overhead scales appropriately** with tensor size (diminishing for large tensors)
3. **The system remains performant** across different hardware platforms
4. **Regressions are detected early** during development

## Performance Gate Definitions

### Gate 1: Small Tensor Operations (< 1KB)

**Scope**: Operations on tensors with size < 1KB (10 to 100 elements for f32)

**Threshold**: Maximum 5% overhead acceptable

**Rationale**:
- Dispatch setup (lock acquisition, HashMap lookup, kernel selection) is significant relative to computation
- These operations are less common in production workloads
- 5% overhead translates to microseconds, which is acceptable
- Most tensor operations in deep learning are on medium to large tensors

**Measurable**: `bench_comprehensive_overhead_analysis` - `tiny_*` and `small_*` configurations

```
tiny_10   - 10 elements:    Max 5% overhead
small_100 - 100 elements:   Max 5% overhead
```

### Gate 2: Medium Tensor Operations (1KB - 100KB)

**Scope**: Operations on tensors from 1KB to 100KB (1,000 to 10,000 elements for f32)

**Threshold**: Maximum 2% overhead acceptable

**Rationale**:
- This is the most common size range for tensor operations in training
- Computation time is now significant, amortizing dispatch overhead
- 2% overhead is imperceptible in most workloads
- Lock contention is negligible at typical thread counts

**Measurable**: `bench_comprehensive_overhead_analysis` - `medium_*` configurations

```
medium_1k  - 1,000 elements:  Max 2% overhead
large_10k  - 10,000 elements: Max 1% overhead (approaching large threshold)
```

### Gate 3: Large Tensor Operations (> 100KB)

**Scope**: Operations on tensors larger than 100KB (100,000+ elements for f32)

**Threshold**: Maximum 1% overhead acceptable

**Rationale**:
- Computation dominates execution time
- Dispatch overhead is negligible (nanoseconds vs microseconds/milliseconds of computation)
- These are the most important to optimize for
- < 1% overhead means dispatch is not a performance concern

**Measurable**: `bench_comprehensive_overhead_analysis` - `xlarge_*` configurations

```
xlarge_100k - 100,000 elements: Max 1% overhead
```

### Gate 4: Operation Type Thresholds

Different operation types may have slightly different overhead characteristics:

**Binary Operations** (add, mul, sub, div, etc.):
- Threshold: 3% overhead
- Reason: Requires device compatibility check in addition to registry lookup

**Unary Operations** (abs, sqrt, sin, etc.):
- Threshold: 2% overhead
- Reason: Simpler path with single tensor device check

**Chained Operations** (a + b) * c:
- Threshold: 1.5% overhead per operation
- Reason: Amortization of overhead across operations
- Total for 2 operations: < 3% for sequence

### Gate 5: Scalability Analysis

**Metric**: Overhead percentage should decrease as tensor size increases

**Expected pattern**:
```
Size         Overhead%
10           4.5%
100          3.8%
1,000        1.2%
10,000       0.8%
100,000      0.3%
```

**Failure Criteria**:
- If overhead increases with tensor size (indicates lock contention or O(n) scaling issue)
- If small tensor overhead exceeds 6% (indicates excessive dispatch overhead)
- If large tensor overhead exceeds 2% (indicates non-scalable implementation)

### Gate 6: Contention Analysis

**Metric**: Dispatch registry should not have lock contention issues

**Single-threaded baseline**: < 1% variance across sequential calls

**Under concurrent load** (future enhancement):
- Contention should scale sub-linearly with thread count
- No pathological cases where contention causes > 10% overhead

## Threshold Justification

### Why These Specific Numbers?

1. **5% for small tensors**: Acceptable because small tensors are rare in production
2. **2% for medium tensors**: Imperceptible in user-facing operations
3. **1% for large tensors**: Computation dominates, dispatch is negligible
4. **Scalability requirement**: Must improve with tensor size, not degrade

### Hardware Considerations

Thresholds are calibrated for:
- Modern CPUs (2018+) with cache hierarchies
- Standard L1/L2/L3 cache sizes
- Typical memory bandwidths (50-100 GB/s)
- Single to multi-threaded workloads (up to 64 cores)

Platform-specific notes:
- **x86_64**: Thresholds are primary targets
- **ARM/M1/M2**: Similar thresholds but may vary by ±1%
- **GPU dispatch**: Different overhead profile, separate benchmarks

## Interpreting Benchmark Results

### Passing Benchmark
```
✓ add_medium_1k: dispatch=12100ns, direct=12000ns, overhead=0.83% (threshold=2%)
```
- Operation passed its performance gate
- Overhead is well below threshold
- No action required

### Failing Benchmark
```
✗ add_tiny_10: dispatch=450ns, direct=400ns, overhead=12.5% (threshold=5%)
```
- Operation exceeded its performance gate
- Overhead is 12.5% vs 5% acceptable
- Investigation required - see "Performance Regression Analysis" below

### Marginal Passing Benchmark
```
✓ add_small_100: dispatch=1210ns, direct=1200ns, overhead=4.8% (threshold=5%)
```
- Operation technically passes but is close to threshold
- Monitor in future benchmarks for trends
- Consider optimization if trend is upward

## Performance Regression Analysis

If benchmarks fail thresholds, investigate in this order:

### Step 1: Verify Measurement

Run benchmark multiple times to ensure result is stable:
```bash
cargo bench --bench dispatch_benchmarks -- --verbose -- iterations=100
```

Dispatch overhead should be consistent (±5% variance is normal).

### Step 2: Identify Root Cause

Check for these common causes:

**Lock Contention**:
- Symptom: Overhead increases with thread count or system load
- Solution: Use lock-free synchronization (parking_lot, crossbeam)

**Compiler Optimization Changes**:
- Symptom: Overhead suddenly increases with new Rust version
- Solution: Check Rust release notes, file issue if regression

**Code Changes**:
- Symptom: Overhead was fine before recent commit
- Solution: Bisect to find problematic change

**Hardware Load**:
- Symptom: Results vary widely between runs
- Solution: Run on dedicated hardware, minimize background processes

### Step 3: Investigate Code

Profile the dispatch path:
```bash
cargo build --release --bin dispatch_benchmarks
perf record ./target/release/deps/dispatch_benchmarks
perf report
```

Look for:
- Expensive lock operations
- Unnecessary HashMap allocations
- Inefficient kernel selection logic
- Cache misses

### Step 4: Implement Fix

Common optimizations:
1. Use parking_lot::RwLock instead of std::sync::RwLock
2. Pre-compute best kernel for device (avoid per-call selection)
3. Cache operation lookups
4. Use lock-free synchronization where possible
