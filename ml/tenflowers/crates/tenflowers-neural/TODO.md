# TenfloweRS Neural TODO & Roadmap (v0.2.1)

v0.1.1 focus: neural network capabilities and forward development plan.

## v0.1.2 — Honesty Hardening (2026-06-22, continued 2026-07-07)

- Removed production lock-poison panics via signature-preserving recovery; a
  poisoned lock no longer aborts the process.
- Fixed the MultiHeadAttention head-reshape bug (the `[0,2,1,3]` permutation),
  unblocking the neural Transformer encoder/decoder.
- `data_parallel` ran a no-op "simulate_backward" → real gradient computation.
- `ultra_dense*` layers used zeros-init → real random initialization.
- Fabricated attention/layer metrics → real computed values or an honest
  "not measured" sentinel.
- NCCL collectives and TensorFlow protobuf import now return honest errors
  (were faked) until their runtimes/parsers are wired.
- (2026-07-07) Gloo, MPI, and Thread communication backends (`src/backends/{gloo,mpi,thread}.rs`)
  now get the same honest-error treatment as NCCL: `all_reduce`/`all_gather`/`broadcast`/
  `send_f32`/`recv_f32` return `NotImplemented` instead of silently scaling, echoing, or
  cloning the caller's own local tensor as a fake cross-rank result. Thread backend's dead
  `mpsc`-channel scaffolding (receiver dropped immediately, so sends silently no-op'd) removed.
- (2026-07-07) `DataParallelTrainer::train_step` (`src/training/data_parallel.rs`): backward
  pass was fully simulated (gradient buckets marked "ready" without computing anything) and
  the optimizer step zeroed gradients as a placeholder — now computes real per-parameter
  gradients via central finite differences against the actual mini-batch loss, all-reduces
  them, and calls the real optimizer step.
- (2026-07-07) `deployment::pruning::engine`: every strategy previously computed statistics
  from synthetic simulated data and returned an unmodified, fabricated `Sequential`;
  `Magnitude`/`Random` pruning now genuinely zero real weight tensors (actual magnitude
  quantiles / seeded RNG), while `Structured`/`Gradual`/`LotteryTicket` honestly report
  `NotImplemented` with a specific rationale instead of fabricating results.
- (2026-07-07) `layers::moe::TopKRouter` routed everything to expert 0 unconditionally — now
  performs real top-k expert selection with a genuine Switch-Transformer-style
  load-balancing loss; `MixtureOfExperts::forward` evaluates and combines every selected
  expert with renormalized weights.
- (2026-07-07) `serialization::weight_loader`: every format previously silently no-op'd
  (`load_*` returned an empty weight map with a warning, `save_*` wrote nothing while
  returning `Ok`) — now a real, versioned JSON weight save/load format; `Binary`/
  `SafeTensors`/`NumPy` honestly report `NotImplemented` naming the missing dependency.
- (2026-07-07) `tensorflow_compat::SavedModelLoader`: `load_from_pb`/`parse_pbtxt_content`
  no longer fabricate a `SavedModel` with hardcoded metadata; `convert_operation_to_layer`
  now derives real layer dimensions from the operation's actual weight tensor, honestly
  erroring when no matching weight variable exists.
- (2026-07-07) ONNX protobuf handling (`serialization::onnx`, `onnx::data`): `OnnxLoader::
  load_from_file`/`load_from_bytes` now perform real prost-based protobuf decoding behind
  the `onnx` feature (previously hardcoded `Err`s); `convert_weights` does real byte-level
  reinterpretation of ONNX initializer data into `Tensor<T>` via `bytemuck`; `OnnxTensor::
  from_protobuf`/`OnnxAttribute::from_protobuf` now reject unrecognized protobuf type codes
  with an error instead of silently defaulting to `Float32`/`Float(0.0)` (`OnnxValueInfo::
  from_protobuf` still defaults unrecognized element-type codes to `Float32` — a
  documented, genuine representational limit of that struct, which only distinguishes 4
  dtypes).

## 2. Current Gaps & Limitations

### Missing Core Components
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Multi-head and scaled dot-product attention not yet implemented
- **Advanced Schedulers**: Learning rate schedulers (cosine, one-cycle, warmup) absent
- **Regularization**: Limited gradient clipping and anomaly detection capabilities
- **Parameter Management**: No parameter grouping or advanced weight decay configurability

### Pretrained Model Integration
- **Model Import/Export**: No exporter/importer for pretrained models from external frameworks
- **ONNX Integration**: Limited ONNX model loading and conversion capabilities
- **Weight Loading**: No standardized format for loading pretrained weights
- **Model Zoo**: No integrated model repository or download capabilities

### Training Features
- **Mixed Precision Polish**: Experimental status, lacks granularity and dynamic loss scaling
- **Distributed Training**: No distributed/multi-GPU training integration with optimizer states
- **Advanced Regularization**: Missing label smoothing, stochastic depth, dropout variants
- **Sequence Models**: Long-sequence stability testing incomplete (Mamba/SSM @ 32K tokens)

### Performance & Memory
- **Memory Optimization**: Limited memory-efficient training techniques
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: No activation recompute for memory-efficient training
- **Model Parallelism**: No support for model parallel or pipeline parallel training

### Honest-error deferrals (post-2026-06-22/2026-07-07 sweeps; fail loudly, not faked)
- **NCCL collective ops**: require the `libnccl` runtime; return an honest error until linked.
- **Gloo/MPI/Thread collective ops**: none of these backends links a real collective-communications
  runtime either; `all_reduce`/`all_gather`/`broadcast`/`send_f32`/`recv_f32` all return an honest
  `NotImplemented` naming the missing transport rather than faking a result. There is currently no
  backend in this crate that performs genuine cross-process/cross-rank communication.
- **Pruning `Structured`/`Gradual`/`LotteryTicket` strategies**: honestly report `NotImplemented`
  with a specific rationale (only `Magnitude`/`Random` pruning are real today).
- **Weight-loader `Binary`/`SafeTensors`/`NumPy` formats**: honestly report `NotImplemented` naming
  the missing dependency (only the JSON format is real today).
- **TensorFlow protobuf import**: no protobuf parser wired → honest error (the separate
  `tenflowers-neural::serialization::onnx` / `onnx::data` ONNX subsystem now has a real,
  prost-based protobuf decoder, unlike TensorFlow SavedModel import).

---

**v0.1.1 Status** (historical snapshot): Production-ready neural network library with comprehensive layer implementations, training infrastructure, and model management. 1,012/1,012 tests passing with 100% pass rate.

**v0.1.2 Status** (2026-07-07): 11,596/11,596 tests passing, 8 skipped (`cargo nextest run -p tenflowers-neural --all-features`). See the "Honesty Hardening" section above for this cycle's fixes — several previously-fabricated code paths (distributed collective ops, several pruning strategies, weight-loader binary formats) now honestly report `NotImplemented` rather than faking success, which is a net increase in correctness even though it narrows what's marked "done" below.

**v0.2.0 Status** (current, 2026-07-13): No functional source changes landed in this crate for the 0.2.0 release (the 0.2.0 release's substantive work was in `tenflowers-autograd` — Softmax/BatchNorm/LayerNorm/GroupNorm backward-pass correctness fixes, real Slice/Gather backward, and a dedicated Conv1D backward — and in `tenflowers-core` — a strided-slice indexing fix and a `--no-default-features` build-gating fix; see those crates' TODO.md for details). Test count carried forward unchanged: 11,596/11,596 passing, 8 skipped, `--all-features`, 0 `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()` remaining (last verified 2026-07-11; not re-run for this docs-only refresh pass).

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Multi-head attention with Flash Attention support
- ✅ Complete learning rate scheduler suite (Step, Cosine, Exponential, Warmup, etc.)
- ✅ Gradient clipping utilities (by value and by norm)
- ✅ Comprehensive serialization system with versioning and compression
- ⚠️ Distributed training scaffolding with multiple backend interfaces (Gloo, MPI, Thread, NCCL) —
  as of 2026-07-07 all four honestly report `NotImplemented` for actual cross-rank collective ops
  (no real transport is linked); `DataParallelTrainer::train_step` itself does real local gradient
  computation (finite differences) and a real optimizer step, single-process
- ⚠️ Deployment features (quantization, mobile optimization) plus partial pruning — `Magnitude`/
  `Random` pruning strategies are real (genuinely zero weights by magnitude/seeded RNG);
  `Structured`/`Gradual`/`LotteryTicket` honestly report `NotImplemented` as of 2026-07-07
- ✅ PEFT methods (LoRA, QLoRA, Prefix Tuning, P-Tuning v2)
- ✅ Model registry system for pretrained model management (12 tests)
- ✅ Weight loading system with a real versioned JSON format (16 tests); Binary/SafeTensors/NumPy
  honestly report `NotImplemented`
- ✅ ONNX integration with real prost-based protobuf decode/encode behind the `onnx` feature (23 tests)
- ✅ Long sequence stability testing infrastructure (26 tests: 8K, 16K, 32K token support)
- ✅ Enhanced training metrics system with statistical analysis (44 tests)
- ✅ Model inspection and debugging utilities (33 tests: layer analysis, gradient flow, profiling)
- ✅ Data augmentation framework (34 tests: image, text, audio augmentation)
- ✅ Batch processing utilities (30 tests: sampling, collation, padding strategies)
- ✅ Training visualization helpers (28 tests: plots, confusion matrices, histograms)
- ✅ Complete test coverage with 100% pass rate (11,596 tests passing, 8 skipped, as of 2026-07-07)

**Next Steps**:
1. Comprehensive API documentation and usage guides
2. ~~ONNX protobuf parsing implementation~~ — DONE (2026-07-07): real prost-based decode/encode
   behind the `onnx` feature, in `serialization::onnx` and `onnx::data`
3. Real collective-communications transport for at least one of Gloo/MPI/NCCL/Thread (all four
   currently return honest `NotImplemented` for cross-rank ops — none links a real runtime)
4. `Structured`/`Gradual`/`LotteryTicket` pruning strategies (currently honest `NotImplemented`)
5. `Binary`/`SafeTensors`/`NumPy` weight-loader formats (currently honest `NotImplemented`;
   only JSON is implemented)
