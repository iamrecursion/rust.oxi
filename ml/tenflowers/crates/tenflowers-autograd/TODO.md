# TenfloweRS Autograd TODO & Roadmap (v0.2.1)

v0.1.1 focus: automatic differentiation capabilities and forward development plan.

## v0.1.2 — Honesty Hardening (2026-06-22)

- Removed production lock-poison panics via signature-preserving recovery; a
  poisoned lock no longer aborts the process.
- `relu_mask` returned all-ones → real 0/1 mask (or honest error when the
  tensor is host-inaccessible, e.g. on device).
- Fused Mish returned `tanh` → real Mish; fused norm/linear/conv ops that
  silently dropped the op → honest error.
- Gradient cache stored empty data → real store/load round-trip.
- Memory stats were hardcoded → real profiler values.

## v0.1.2 — Second Honesty-Hardening Wave (2026-07-07 release)

- `CrossDatacenterReplicator`/`DatacenterConnection` network-simulation
  methods (`broadcast_prepare`/`broadcast_commit`, `aggregate_parameters*`,
  `get_current_step`, `get_datacenter_steps`, `collect_all_parameters`,
  `get_health`, `DatacenterConnection::new`, bandwidth/congestion/RTT
  helpers) previously fabricated successful cross-datacenter coordination
  (fake `PrepareResult`, pass-through "aggregation", hardcoded step
  counters, always-healthy status) with no real network transport →
  now return honest `NotImplemented` errors describing the missing
  transport; several gained `Result` return types as a result (**breaking
  change** for direct callers).
- `numerical_checker::property_test` gained a required `f_grad` closure
  parameter and now genuinely compares the analytical gradient against
  it — previously the "analytical" value was just a clone of the
  numerical estimate, so every property test trivially passed regardless
  of correctness.
- `kernel_fusion::FusableOp::Mish` fixed from a `tanh` approximation
  (numerically wrong: `mish(2.0)` ≈ 1.944 vs. `tanh(2.0)` ≈ 0.964) to the
  real `mish` op; `BatchNorm`/`LayerNorm`/`GroupNorm`/`Conv2D`/`Linear`/
  `Scale`/`Bias` fused ops changed from silently passing input through
  unchanged (fake identity) to an honest `Err`.
- Conv2D/Conv3D backward gradients (`compute_conv2d_input_gradient`,
  `compute_conv2d_weight_gradient`, `compute_conv3d_input_gradient`,
  `compute_conv3d_weight_gradient` in `ops::convolution_ops::utils`) fixed
  from zero-tensor placeholders to real, correct transposed-cross-correlation
  implementations, validated by new finite-difference gradient-check tests.
- `neural_integration::trainer::compute_accuracy` fixed from a hardcoded
  `0.95` constant to a real argmax-based (multi-class) or
  threshold-based (binary) accuracy computation.
- New `distributed = ["tokio"]` feature flag gating the
  `pub mod distributed_replication` re-export of
  `cross_datacenter_replication`.
- New `tenflowers_autograd::init()` entry point registers a real
  `GradientExecutor` implementation (`AutogradGradientExecutor`,
  supporting `add/sub/mul/div/matmul/pow`, `relu/sigmoid/tanh`, and
  `"->"`-composed unary chains) with `tenflowers-core`'s
  `gradient_validation_framework`, so `Finiteness`/`ZeroForConstants`/
  `Linearity`/`ChainRule` checks can be genuinely verified instead of
  honestly reporting "unverified" by default.
- Verified 2026-07-07: `cargo nextest run -p tenflowers-autograd
  --all-features` → **521 tests run: 521 passed, 5 skipped**.

## v0.2.0 — Backward-Pass Correctness Sweep (2026-07-13)

Real, previously-unknown gradient-computation bugs were found and fixed this
cycle (as opposed to the honesty-hardening waves above, which mostly
replaced fabricated results with honest errors — these are genuine
correctness fixes to gradients that were previously silently wrong):

- **Softmax backward** (`tape::gradient_computation::activation_ops::
  process_softmax_backward`) now delegates to `grad_ops::softmax_backward`
  (the formula `grad_x = y * (grad_y - sum_axis(y * grad_y))`) instead of
  computing the gradient inline in the tape dispatcher, closing a drift
  risk between the two implementations.
- **BatchNorm backward** and **LayerNorm backward**
  (`tape::gradient_computation::neural_ops::{process_batchnorm_backward,
  process_layernorm_backward}`) now delegate to the real
  `ops::normalization_ops::{batch_norm_backward, layer_norm_backward}`
  kernels rather than reimplementing the backward formula in the dispatcher.
- **GroupNorm backward** (`ops::normalization_ops::group_norm_backward`)
  fixed a bug where `gamma` was applied as a single post-hoc `gamma / std`
  factor to the final gradient — correct only when `gamma` is uniform
  across every channel in a group, since in general `gamma *
  sum(grad_out) != sum(gamma * grad_out)`. Real-world measurement against a
  non-uniform-gamma test case showed relative error up to ~760% before the
  fix. Fixed to fold per-channel `gamma` into `dxhat` (`dxhat = grad_output
  * gamma`) before the reduction sums are taken, matching the same
  correction already applied to instance-norm-style backward math
  elsewhere in this module.
- **Slice backward** and **Gather backward** (`grad_ops::tensor_ops::
  {slice_backward, gather_backward}`) were stubs; now produce real
  gradients — `slice_backward` walks every coordinate of `grad_output`
  (row-major), maps it dimension-by-dimension back through
  `start_d + out_coord[d] * step_d`, and accumulates (not overwrites) into
  `grad_input`; `gather_backward` maps output coordinates back through the
  gather indices and accumulates into the input buffer (with bounds
  checking), correctly handling repeated indices.
- **Conv1D** gained a dedicated backward implementation
  (`ops::convolution_ops::conv1d::conv1d_backward`, with
  `compute_conv1d_input_gradient`/`compute_conv1d_weight_gradient` helpers
  in `conv1d_utils.rs`) instead of having no backward path at all.
- New finite-difference gradient-check test suites added under `tests/`
  (47 test functions total): `activation_gaps_gradient_test.rs` (16),
  `conv1d_gradient_test.rs` (4), `conv3d_gradient_test.rs` (4),
  `group_instance_norm_gradient_check.rs` (5),
  `normalization_gradient_check.rs` (7),
  `slice_concat_stack_split_gather_gradient_test.rs` (11).
- Verified 2026-07-11: `cargo nextest run -p tenflowers-autograd
  --all-features` → **575 tests run: 575 passed, 5 skipped**.

## 2. Current Gaps & Limitations

### Gradient Coverage
- **Incomplete Operations**: Missing gradients for advanced manipulation, sparse operations, complex neural ops
- **Coverage Gaps**: Systematic audit needed to identify and fill gradient implementation gaps
- **Numerical Validation**: Limited property-based numerical gradient checking

### Advanced Features
- **Higher-Order Reliability**: Higher-order gradients unreliable for composite activation chains
- **Mixed Precision Polish**: Experimental status, lacks granularity and dynamic loss scaling refinement
- **Checkpointing**: Limited activation recompute ergonomics for memory efficiency

### System Integration
- **Deterministic Execution**: No deterministic seed propagation across forward/backward passes
- **Graph Mode**: Graph-mode gradient integration pending graph optimizer readiness
- **Distributed**: `distributed` feature flag and `distributed_replication` module scaffolding exist, but no real network transport is wired up — every cross-datacenter coordination call honestly errors rather than aggregating gradients across multi-GPU/multi-host scenarios (see Honest-error deferrals below)
- **Custom-gradient backward wiring**: `CustomGradientOp::apply` runs the custom forward pass and records the output on the tape, but does not yet register the custom `backward` for traversal by `tape.gradient()` — full round-trip custom-gradient support is not yet complete

### Honest-error deferrals (post-2026-06-22 sweep; fail loudly, not faked)
- **`relu_mask` on host-inaccessible tensors**: returns an honest error rather than a fabricated all-ones mask (CPU path computes the real 0/1 mask).
- **Fused norm/linear/conv ops**: paths that previously dropped the operation silently now return an honest error until the real fused kernel lands.

### Honest-error deferrals (2026-07-07 sweep; fail loudly, not faked)
- **`CrossDatacenterReplicator`/`DatacenterConnection`**: every network-simulation method (`broadcast_prepare`/`broadcast_commit`, `aggregate_parameters*`, `get_current_step`, `get_datacenter_steps`, `collect_all_parameters`, `get_health`, `DatacenterConnection::new`, bandwidth/congestion/RTT helpers) now returns an honest `NotImplemented` naming the missing transport, rather than fabricating successful cross-datacenter coordination. A real network transport implementation remains a deferred item (see Mid-Term Roadmap, Distributed Computing).
- **`GradientExecutor` for `tenflowers-core`'s validation framework**: without calling `tenflowers_autograd::init()`, `gradient_validation_framework`'s `Finiteness`/`ZeroForConstants`/`Linearity`/`ChainRule` checks honestly report "unverified" rather than fabricating `passed: true`. Calling `init()` registers `AutogradGradientExecutor`, which covers `add/sub/mul/div/matmul/pow`, `relu/sigmoid/tanh`, and `"->"`-composed unary chains — other operations remain unverified even after `init()`.

---

**v0.1.2 Status** (2026-07-07): Production-ready automatic differentiation system with comprehensive gradient tape, memory profiling, and performance optimization; 521 tests passing, 5 skipped (`--all-features`), 0 clippy warnings. This cycle's focus was honesty hardening — replacing fabricated/placeholder results (cross-datacenter replication, fused Mish/norm ops, conv2d/conv3d backward gradients, training accuracy, numerical gradient property tests) with either real implementations or honest `NotImplemented` errors.

**v0.2.0 Status** (2026-07-13): 575 tests passing, 5 skipped (`--all-features`), 0 clippy warnings (verified 2026-07-11, one day before release). This cycle's focus shifted from honesty hardening to backward-pass *correctness* — Softmax/BatchNorm/LayerNorm backward now delegate to already-correct kernels instead of a separately-maintained (and drifted) inline formula in the tape dispatcher; GroupNorm backward fixed a non-uniform-gamma bug (up to ~760% relative error); Slice and Gather backward went from stubs to real gradients; Conv1D gained a dedicated backward implementation. All verified by new finite-difference gradient-check test suites. Forward development still focuses on gradient coverage audit, real distributed-gradient transport, and advanced features.
