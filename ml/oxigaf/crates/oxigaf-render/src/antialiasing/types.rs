/// Configuration for Mip-Splatting anti-aliasing.
///
/// Three presets are available:
/// - [`MipSplatConfig::default`] — balanced settings suitable for most scenes.
/// - [`MipSplatConfig::aggressive`] — stronger filtering, trades more opacity
///   reduction for fewer aliasing artifacts on distant Gaussians.
/// - [`MipSplatConfig::conservative`] — minimal filtering, preserves more
///   detail at the cost of some sub-pixel aliasing.
