//! Sent-packet tracking for loss detection and recovery (RFC 9002 Section 3,
//! Appendix A.1).
//!
//! To retransmit data lost on a congested or lossy path, the transport must
//! remember which ack-eliciting frames it placed in each packet it sent. This
//! module records, per packet-number space, every in-flight ack-eliciting
//! packet — its packet number, the time it was sent, its size on the wire, and
//! the retransmittable frames it carried ([`SentFrame`]). When an `ACK`
//! acknowledges a packet the record is removed; when loss detection declares a
//! packet lost the connection re-queues the recorded frames for retransmission.
//!
//! The drained-buffer send path (`CryptoStream::take_send` / `SendStream::take`)
//! is paired with this store: each packet built by the connection is registered
//! here with the frames it carried, so nothing is lost without a record to
//! re-queue it from.
