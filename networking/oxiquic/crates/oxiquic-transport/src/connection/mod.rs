//! The synchronous, I/O-free QUIC connection state machine.
//!
//! [`Connection`] owns a `rustls::quic` TLS endpoint, the three packet-number
//! spaces and their CRYPTO streams, and drives the handshake by pumping
//! `write_hs`/`read_hs` and translating between TLS handshake bytes and
//! protected QUIC packets. It performs no I/O: the caller feeds it received
//! datagrams via [`Connection::handle_datagram`] and pulls datagrams to send via
//! [`Connection::poll_transmit`]. The asynchronous [`crate::endpoint`] shell
//! wires those to a UDP socket.
//!
//! Milestone coverage: M1 (handshake), M2 (1-RTT keys, HANDSHAKE_DONE,
//! CONNECTION_CLOSE, idle timeout) and M3 (stream data) are implemented here;
//! see the module-level methods for the per-milestone surface.
