//! Connection ID pool management (RFC 9000 §§5.1, 19.15, 19.16).
//!
//! Tracks CIDs this endpoint issues to the peer ([`LocalCidPool`]) and CIDs
//! the peer issued to us ([`PeerCidPool`]). Both pools maintain
//! sequence-number order and honour `active_connection_id_limit`.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! Every connection starts with seq 0 in both pools — the CIDs exchanged in
//! the packet headers during the handshake. Post-handshake, each side issues
//! additional CIDs via NEW_CONNECTION_ID (up to the peer's advertised
//! `active_connection_id_limit`), enabling path migration without re-handshake.
//!
//! When the peer retires one of our CIDs (`RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID`), we remove
//! it from `LocalCidPool` and emit a `CidEvent::Unregister` so the endpoint
//! demux can remove it from its routing table. We then issue a fresh CID
//! (`CidEvent::Register`) to keep the peer's pool replenished.
//!
//! When we decide to retire a peer-issued CID (e.g. because the peer demanded
//! it via `retire_prior_to`), `PeerCidPool` queues a `RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID`
//! frame for transmission.
//!
//! # Migration (RFC 9000 §9.5)
//!
//! An endpoint that migrates must stop using the connection IDs it used on the
//! old path, otherwise an observer on both paths can link them. Driving that
//! from the *issuing* side is what [`LocalCidPool::begin_rotation`] is for: it
//! raises the `retire_prior_to` threshold that every subsequent
//! NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame advertises, which asks the peer to retire everything
//! issued before the migration and to switch to the CIDs issued after it.
//!
//! CIDs below the threshold stay in `active` — and therefore stay routable —
//! until the peer's RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID actually arrives, because packets
//! carrying them may still be in flight. They are, however, excluded from the
//! `active_connection_id_limit` accounting ([`LocalCidPool::issuable_count`]),
//! exactly mirroring the count the peer performs in
//! [`PeerCidPool::receive_new_cid`]; that is what frees the slots the fresh
//! CIDs occupy.
