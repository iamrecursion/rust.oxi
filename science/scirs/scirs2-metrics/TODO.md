# scirs2-metrics TODO

## Status: v0.6.5 (last updated 2026-07-31)

Untouched by this release's fix work (no metrics-specific changes shipped in 0.6.5); the
implementation-status survey below (last performed for the 0.6.2 release, 2026-07-22) remains
accurate for 0.6.5 since the crate source is unchanged.

## v0.3.3 Completed

### Classification Metrics
- [x] `accuracy_score` with sample weighting
- [x] `precision_score`, `recall_score`, `f1_score`, `fbeta_score`
- [x] `precision_recall_fscore_support` (all in one)
- [x] Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)
- [x] Balanced accuracy, Cohen's kappa
- [x] `roc_curve`, `roc_auc_score`
- [x] `average_precision_score`, `precision_recall_curve`
- [x] `confusion_matrix`, `classification_report`
- [x] `log_loss`, `brier_score_loss`
- [x] `hamming_loss`, `jaccard_score`
- [ ] `hinge_loss` — no function by this exact name in `classification`; the real, wired function is `sklearn_compat::hinge_loss_sklearn` (verified 2026-07-15)
- [x] Multi-class: micro/macro/weighted/samples averaging
- [x] `cohen_kappa_score`, `matthews_corrcoef`
- [x] Optimal threshold: `g_means_score`, `find_optimal_threshold`

### Regression Metrics
- [x] `mean_squared_error` (MSE), `root_mean_squared_error` (RMSE)
- [x] `mean_absolute_error` (MAE), `median_absolute_error`
- [x] `mean_absolute_percentage_error` (MAPE), symmetric MAPE
- [x] `r2_score`, `explained_variance_score`, adjusted R²
- [x] `mean_squared_log_error` (MSLE)
- [x] `mean_tweedie_deviance`, Poisson/Gamma deviance
- [x] Huber loss, quantile (pinball) loss
- [x] Max error, relative absolute/squared error
- [ ] `regression_advanced`: interval score, coverage probability, Winkler score — code exists (`src/regression_advanced/mod.rs`: `coverage_error`, `interval_width`, `winkler_score`, `continuous_ranked_probability_score`, `energy_score`) but the module is never declared in `lib.rs`, so it is dead code and unreachable from the public API (verified 2026-07-15). Needs a `pub mod regression_advanced;` wire-up, or removal if intentionally superseded.

### Clustering Metrics
- [x] `silhouette_score`, `silhouette_samples`
- [x] `calinski_harabasz_score` (variance ratio)
- [x] `davies_bouldin_score`

- [x] `normalized_mutual_info_score`, `adjusted_mutual_info_score`
- [x] `homogeneity_completeness_v_measure`

- [x] Cluster stability, consensus scoring

### Ranking and Information Retrieval
- [x] `ndcg_score` at k, DCG

- [x] `precision_at_k`, `recall_at_k`
- [x] Kendall's tau, Spearman's rank correlation
- [x] Label ranking average precision (LRAP)
- [ ] `ir_metrics` module: comprehensive IR evaluation — `src/ranking/ir_metrics.rs` exists but is never declared in `lib.rs` (no `pub mod`/`mod` anywhere), so it does not compile into the crate; it is superseded by the wired `ranking/mod.rs`, which already covers NDCG/MAP/MRR/precision@k/recall@k (verified 2026-07-15)

### Object Detection Metrics (New in v0.3.1)

- [ ] `streaming/optimization/patterns/buffering.rs` - ring-buffer streaming — same as above; unreachable (verified 2026-07-15)
- [ ] `streaming/optimization/patterns/partitioning.rs` - keyed/group metrics — same as above; unreachable (verified 2026-07-15)

### Evaluation Framework
- [x] K-fold cross-validation, stratified K-fold, leave-one-out

- [x] Learning curve, validation curve generation
- [ ] `grid_search_cv`, `randomized_search_cv` — not implemented anywhere in the crate (verified 2026-07-15); the closest available tool is `integration::optim::HyperParameterTuner::random_search`, which is a black-box search over a user-supplied eval function rather than a CV-grid search

- [x] `HyperParameterTuner` with random and grid search
- [ ] `MetricBasedReduceOnPlateau` optimizer wrapper — no struct/function by this name found (verified 2026-07-15); the real reduce-on-plateau scheduler is `integration::optim::MetricLRScheduler` (`step_with_metric`, patience/factor/min_lr)

### Documentation and Examples
- [x] Comprehensive cookbook with domain-specific metric selection guides (planned 2026-04-17)
  - **Goal:** 6 runnable Rust examples under `scirs2-metrics/examples/cookbook_*.rs` — one per domain: classification, regression, ranking, clustering, distribution, calibration. No new markdown docs.
  - **Design:** Each example: (1) synthetic data via `scirs2_core::random`, (2) compute metrics, (3) print tabulated comparison with inline commentary on when each metric is appropriate.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-metrics/examples/cookbook_{classification,regression,ranking,clustering,distribution,calibration}.rs` (all new), `scirs2-metrics/TODO.md`.
  - **Tests:** Compile-check via `cargo check --examples -p scirs2-metrics`. Add `examples_compile_check` test.
  - **Risk:** Low — examples validated via `cargo check --examples`.
- [x] Integration examples with popular ML frameworks (planned 2026-04-17)
  - **Goal:** 4 runnable examples showing SciRS2 ML module outputs → `scirs2-metrics` evaluation: neural, optimize, cluster, transform.
  - **Design:** `scirs2-metrics/examples/integration_{neural,optimize,cluster,transform}.rs`. Each generates synthetic data, runs sister-crate algorithm, computes metrics. Add sister crates as dev-deps if not present.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-metrics/examples/integration_{neural,optimize,cluster,transform}.rs` (all new), `scirs2-metrics/Cargo.toml`, `scirs2-metrics/TODO.md`.
  - **Tests:** Compile-check all 4. `framework_integration_compile_check` test.
  - **Risk:** Circular dev-deps possible — check; if circular, move to sister crate.
- [x] Benchmark report vs `sklearn.metrics` (planned 2026-04-17)
  - **Goal:** Criterion benchmark suite `scirs2-metrics/benches/sklearn_comparison.rs` measuring per-metric throughput (n=10³,10⁴,10⁵). Reference sklearn numbers from published benchmarks (hard-coded, cited). `cargo run --example sklearn_comparison_summary` prints speedup table.
  - **Design:** Criterion benches for classification (accuracy/F1/ROC-AUC), regression (MSE/MAE/R²), ranking (MAP/NDCG), clustering (silhouette). sklearn reference numbers cited from Buitinck et al. 2013.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-metrics/benches/sklearn_comparison.rs` (new), `scirs2-metrics/examples/sklearn_comparison_summary.rs` (new), `scirs2-metrics/Cargo.toml`, `scirs2-metrics/TODO.md`.
  - **Tests:** `cargo bench --bench sklearn_comparison -p scirs2-metrics --no-run` compiles. `sklearn_comparison_bench_compiles` test.
  - **Risk:** No runtime Python needed — reference numbers are static/cited.

## Known Issues

- `plotly_backend` feature generates HTML that requires a network connection to load Chart.js from CDN; add offline/bundled mode.
- `dashboard_server` requires `tokio` runtime; document how to integrate with existing async applications.
- SIMD acceleration (`optimization/hardware.rs`) only tracks x86/x86_64 feature flags (SSE2/AVX/AVX2/AVX-512); ARM NEON is still not tracked as of 0.6.5 despite once being slated for v0.4.0.
- GAN/generative evaluation (`domains::generative_ai::gan_evaluation::GANEvaluationMetrics`: FID, IS, KID) requires pre-computed feature vectors; it does not include the Inception network — document this clearly.
- **Orphaned modules (verified 2026-07-15):** several source files/directories exist under `src/` but have no `pub mod` (or even private `mod`) declaration anywhere in the crate, so they do not compile into the crate and are unreachable from the public API: `generative.rs`, `segmentation.rs`, `regression_advanced/`, `distributional/` (superseded by the wired `distribution/`), `ranking/ir_metrics.rs` (superseded by the wired `ranking/mod.rs`), `fairness/advanced.rs`, `streaming/optimization/` (patterns/config/detection — also missing its own `optimization/mod.rs`), `domains/robotics/` (9 files), `integration/neural/adapter.rs` (superseded by `neural_adapter.rs`). Each needs a decision: wire in via `pub mod`, or delete as dead code.
