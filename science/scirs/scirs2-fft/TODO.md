# scirs2-fft Development TODO

## Status: v0.6.5 (released, 2026-07-31)

Untouched by this release's fix work (no fft-specific changes shipped in 0.6.5); the status and
test results below — last reviewed against source on 2026-07-22 — remain accurate since the crate
source is unchanged.

scirs2-fft's own test suite (freshly re-run 2026-07-22): 674 tests pass, 0 skipped, 0 failed with default features; 718 tests pass, 0 skipped, 0 failed with `--all-features`.

### Performance
- [x] AVX-512 butterfly kernels for radix-4 and radix-8 FFT stages (planned 2026-04-17)
  - **Goal:** Pure-Rust AVX-512 intrinsics path in `butterfly.rs` / `simd_fft/` that delivers measurably faster radix-4 and radix-8 butterflies than the scalar baseline for f32 and f64. Feature-gated on `target_feature = "avx512f"` with runtime dispatch.
  - **Design:** Use `std::arch::x86_64` AVX-512 intrinsics (`_mm512_fmadd_pd`, `_mm512_mul_pd`, `_mm512_permutex_pd`, `_mm512_shuffle_f64x2`, etc.). Radix-4 butterfly on 8 complex f64 lanes (2 radix-4 at once, 8 complex = 16 f64 lanes). Radix-8 butterfly on 4 complex f64 via twiddle pre-fetch. Runtime dispatch: `is_x86_feature_detected!("avx512f")` at the plan boundary; scalar fallback otherwise. Criterion benchmark `butterfly_bench.rs` to demonstrate speedup.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-fft/src/butterfly.rs` (extend), `scirs2-fft/src/simd_fft/avx512.rs` (new), `scirs2-fft/src/simd_fft/mod.rs` (dispatch), `scirs2-fft/benches/butterfly_bench.rs` (new), `scirs2-fft/tests/avx512_correctness_tests.rs` (new), `scirs2-fft/TODO.md`.
  - **Prerequisites:** none.
  - **Tests:** `avx512_radix4_matches_scalar`, `avx512_radix8_matches_scalar`, `avx512_matches_full_fft_on_random_input`, plus gated criterion bench.
  - **Risk:** AVX-512 not available on CI runners → tests gated on `is_x86_feature_detected!("avx512f")` with fallthrough to "skipped on this host" marker. CI compile-checks the path only; document.
- [x] NEON/SVE butterfly kernels for ARM (planned 2026-04-17)
  - **Goal:** ARM64 NEON (AArch64 baseline) and optional SVE (scalable vector length) butterfly kernels, same radix-4 / radix-8 coverage. Feature-gated, runtime-dispatched.
  - **Design:** NEON intrinsics via `std::arch::aarch64` (`vfmaq_f64`, `vmulq_f64`, `vtrnq_f64`, etc.). Radix-4 on 2 complex f64 lanes = 4 f64. Radix-8 via two radix-4 + twiddle. SVE path gated on `target_feature = "sve"`, scalable-length via `svfloat64_t`. Runtime dispatch at plan boundary via `is_aarch64_feature_detected!("neon")` / `is_aarch64_feature_detected!("sve")`.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-fft/src/simd_fft/neon.rs` (new), `scirs2-fft/src/simd_fft/sve.rs` (new), `scirs2-fft/src/simd_fft/mod.rs` (extend dispatch), `scirs2-fft/tests/neon_correctness_tests.rs` (new), `scirs2-fft/TODO.md`.
  - **Prerequisites:** none.
  - **Tests:** `neon_radix4_matches_scalar`, `neon_radix8_matches_scalar`, `sve_radix4_matches_scalar`, plus cross-check against scalar following the avx512 test pattern.
  - **Risk:** SVE availability is sparse on CI; gate its tests behind `is_aarch64_feature_detected!("sve")` and accept compile-only coverage when feature is absent.
- [x] Cache-oblivious recursive FFT (Frigo-Johnson style) — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`cache_oblivious.rs`); real-input variant `cache_oblivious_rfft` added in v0.4.2
- [x] FFT plan serialization for ahead-of-time compilation — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`fft_plan.rs`, `plan_serialization.rs`)

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

- `spectral.rs` was deleted and replaced by the `spectral/` submodule; verify no broken re-exports remain
- `nufft_legacy.rs` (359 lines) was marked for removal in v0.4.1 but is still present at v0.6.1; verified 2026-07-15 that it is now fully orphaned — not declared as a module anywhere (`grep` for `mod nufft_legacy` and for any reference to `nufft_legacy` across `src/` returns nothing outside the file itself), so it is dead code not compiled into the crate at all. Safe to delete in a future source-code pass (out of scope for this docs-only update).
- EMD cubic spline envelope may not converge for highly non-stationary signals; add iteration cap with warning
- NTT works only for inputs whose length divides `p - 1`; document this constraint clearly
- Lomb-Scargle FAP estimation is approximate (chi-squared); implement bootstrap alternative
- [x] No source file currently exceeds 2000 lines (verified 2026-07-15: largest is `src/polynomial/legacy.rs` at 1989 lines); re-check with `rslines 50` if new files grow past the threshold
- GPU sparse FFT feature flags (`cuda`, `hip`, `sycl`) depend on external hardware; CI uses mock backend
- STFT `istft` reconstruction requires correct `noverlap`; add assertion for perfect reconstruction condition
- Wavelet packet tree reconstruction is not yet invertible for all wavelet families; test suite should cover round-trip error
