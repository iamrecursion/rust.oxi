- CUDA/Metal backend selection through scirs2-core GPU abstractions

Status (verified 2026-07-15): `src/gpu_accel.rs` provides `GpuDevice`/`GpuDistanceMatrix`/`GpuNearestNeighbors`/`GpuKMeans` types and the `cuda`/`rocm`/`vulkan` Cargo features, but per the honest documentation in `Cargo.toml` and the doc comments in `gpu_accel.rs`, these features currently gate only GPU *capability detection* (nvidia-smi/rocm-smi/vulkaninfo probes) — actual compute (`compute_cuda`/`compute_rocm`/`compute_vulkan`) delegates straight to the CPU SIMD fallback (`compute_cpu_fallback`). None of the four items above are implemented yet; still open.

### Real-Time Streaming Spatial Queries
- Incremental insertion and deletion in KD-Tree and R*-Tree (kinetic data structures)
- Sliding window spatial queries for streaming point clouds
- Online Voronoi diagram updates with vertex event processing

### Advanced Spatial Statistics — Implemented in v0.4.0
- [x] Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA)
- [x] Kernel density estimation (KDE) with spatial bandwidth selection
- [x] Spatial regression models (spatial lag, spatial error) — see `spatial_lag_model` / `spatial_error_model` in `src/geo/spatial_stats.rs` (2SLS/GMM for SLM, iterative GLS for SEM), tested by `test_spatial_lag_model_basic` / `test_spatial_error_model_basic`
- [x] Spatial scan statistics for cluster detection
- [x] Getis-Ord Gi* statistic

### Large-Scale Geospatial Processing
- Efficient handling of billion-point datasets via chunked R*-Tree
- [x] Hilbert curve spatial sorting for cache-efficient access — see `src/hilbert.rs`
- GeoParquet and GeoArrow format support (via scirs2-io)

## Known Issues

- Voronoi construction for >100K seed points may be slow; use grid-based approximation for large inputs
- Ball Tree does not yet support user-defined distance functions with non-Euclidean metrics in all cases
- [x] R*-Tree deletion is implemented — see `src/rtree/deletion.rs` (lines 17-400) and `src/rect_rtree.rs:747`
- Kriging variogram fitting may diverge without good initial parameter estimates for poorly sampled data

## v0.6.1 Additions (2026-07-07)

- [x] **`distance::hamming()`** — new standalone convenience function computing the proportion of differing coordinates between two equal-length points (tolerance-based float comparison via `T::epsilon()`), matching `scipy.spatial.distance.hamming` semantics; re-exported at the crate root alongside `euclidean`/`jaccard`/etc. This is the first time a `hamming` symbol has existed anywhere in this crate — the "Hamming" entry already listed under Distance Metrics above (and in the `v0.3.3 Completed` section) had no backing implementation until now.
  - Files: `src/distance/functions_2.rs`, `src/distance_tests.rs`, `src/lib.rs`.
  - Workspace: 890 / 854 tests pass (all-features / default-features).

## v0.6.3 Fixes (2026-07-27)

- [x] **Fixed undefined behavior in `DistancePool::create_aligned_buffer`/`create_numa_aware_buffer`** (`src/memory_pool.rs`) — both allocated cache-aligned memory via raw `System.alloc` then freed it through `Box<[f64]>`'s default-aligned `Drop`, an alloc/dealloc layout mismatch that corrupted the heap on Windows (`STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION`). Both now allocate through plain `Vec`/`Box<[f64]>`.
  - Verified by code review and the existing macOS/Linux test suite; not exercised under Windows CI. See `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.6.3]` for full detail.

## v0.6.2 Fixes (2026-07-22)

- [x] **`NumaTopology::detect()` now reads real hardware topology instead of fabricating it** — previously estimated one NUMA node per 8 logical CPUs and hard-coded 1GB of memory per node regardless of the actual machine. On Linux it now reads node count, per-node `cpulist`/`meminfo`, and the firmware ACPI SLIT distance matrix from `/sys/devices/system/node/`; other platforms fall back to an honest single-node layout spanning all detected logical CPUs with memory reported as unknown (`0`) rather than guessed. Affects the `NumaTopology` types in both `src/advanced_parallel.rs` and `src/memory_pool.rs`. The affected test previously asserted a hard-coded `numa_nodes == 1` (only ever passing by coincidence on single-socket machines); it now asserts against the real detected topology.
  - Files: `src/advanced_parallel.rs`, `src/memory_pool.rs`.

## v0.6.5 Fixes (2026-07-31)

- [x] **Fixed inverted `Ord` on the k-nearest-neighbor `BinaryHeap` in `octree` and `quadtree`** (`DistancePoint` in `src/octree.rs`, `src/quadtree.rs`) — `query_nearest`'s `result_queue` keeps the current k best (smallest-distance) candidates and must evict the *worst* (farthest) one once the set grows beyond k; the comparison was inverted (`other.distance_sq.partial_cmp(&self.distance_sq)`), which made the heap treat the *closest* point as the one to evict instead, silently returning the farthest candidates instead of the nearest. Now compares `self.distance_sq` against `other.distance_sq` directly, matching the natural (max-heap) ordering the eviction logic expects. Test assertions in both files that had been weakened to tolerate the bug (e.g. `assert!(indices[0] < points.shape()[0])` in place of the actual expected index) are restored to strict checks (`assert_eq!(indices[0], 0)`).
- [x] **Fixed `pathplanning::astar::AStarPlanner::reconstruct_path` always reporting a path cost of `0.0`** (`src/pathplanning/astar.rs`) — the function walked backward from the goal node to the start node via `parent` links, reassigning `cost = node.g` at every step; since the start node's own g-value is always `0.0`, the final (last-assigned) value was always `0.0` regardless of the actual accumulated path cost. `cost` is now captured once, from the goal node's `g`, before the backward walk begins. Two test assertions previously commented out with "This is a known issue that could be fixed later" (`assert_eq!(path.cost, 8.0)` and a diagonal-path `4.0 * SQRT_2` check) are restored.
- Both fixes verified by the existing macOS/Linux test suite (854/854 default-features, 890/890 all-features — test *counts* unchanged; only previously-weakened assertions were restored to strict checks, not new tests added). Not independently exercised under Windows CI. See `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.6.5]` for full detail.
