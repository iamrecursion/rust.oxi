# scirs2-vision TODO

## Status: v0.6.5 (current, 2026-07-31) — reassessed Stable → Partial

Untouched by this release's fix work (no vision-specific changes shipped in 0.6.1, nor in 0.6.2, nor in 0.6.3,
nor in 0.6.4); this is a fresh implementation-status survey performed for 0.6.2 that remains accurate for
0.6.3, 0.6.4, and 0.6.5 since the crate source is unchanged. 0 `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()` markers in `src/` — but a targeted sweep
for the *silent*-stub pattern (code that compiles, looks real, and returns a plausible-looking value
without actually computing it — the same pattern `scirs2-ndimage`/`scirs2-integrate` are marked
"Partial" for) turned up three confirmed, publicly-reachable instances, so the status badge is
downgraded from Stable to Partial pending fixes. One additional honest gap (clear `Err`, not a
silent no-op) is also tracked below and does **not** by itself justify "Partial" — it is listed
for completeness.

**Confirmed silent stubs (justify the Partial rating):**
1. `vision_3d::structure_from_motion()` (`src/vision_3d.rs`, re-exported at the crate root) — validates
   its `images.len() >= 2` precondition, then unconditionally returns an **empty** `PointCloud`
   (`Array2::zeros((0, 3))`, `colors: None`). The doc comment's own inline plan ("1. Extract features
   ... 5. Bundle adjustment") is not executed at all — no feature extraction, matching, pose
   estimation, or triangulation happens. Every caller silently gets zero points back, with no error.
2. `segmentation::semantic::legacy::FCN::segment()` / `.forward()` (`src/segmentation/semantic/legacy.rs`)
   — `forward()`'s own comment says "Simulate network output with random predictions" / "For
   demonstration: create a simple pattern"; `segment()` returns an all-zeros `class_map` and
   all-zeros `confidence` array. No neural inference occurs. Mitigating context: this lives in a
   module literally named `legacy`, and `segmentation::semantic::deeplab` (ASPP / atrous convolution
   forward pass) alongside `segmentation::panoptic` appear to be the real, current implementations —
   `panoptic.rs` does not reference `legacy::FCN`. So the crate's advertised "Panoptic Segmentation"
   feature is not affected by this particular stub, but `legacy::FCN` is still `pub use`-exported at
   the `segmentation::semantic` level and callable directly by any user who reaches for it.
3. `performance_benchmark::AdvancedBenchmarkSuite` (`src/performance_benchmark.rs`, re-exported at the
   crate root) — of its 8 internal `benchmark_*` methods backing `run_comprehensive_benchmark()`, 6 are
   explicitly commented "// Placeholder implementation" and return hardcoded/default metrics
   (`benchmark_neuromorphic_processing`, `benchmark_ai_optimization`,
   `benchmark_cross_module_integration`, `benchmark_scalability`, `benchmark_quality_accuracy`,
   `benchmark_resource_efficiency`); even the two that do real timing
   (`benchmark_baseline_performance`, `benchmark_quantum_processing`) mix in hardcoded
   `ComparisonMetrics` fields (e.g. `quantum_advantage: 2.3, // Estimated quantum advantage`). This
   benchmarking harness is not mentioned in `README.md`'s feature list, but it is public API.

**Honest gaps (return a clear `Err`, not a silent no-op — do not by themselves justify "Partial"):**
- `VideoSource::VideoFile` / `VideoSource::Camera` in `streaming_modules/video_io.rs` are not
  implemented (only `VideoSource::ImageSequence` and `VideoSource::Dummy` currently work).

None of the above were implemented as part of this documentation pass (out of scope for a README/TODO
accuracy sweep); they are recorded here so the next implementation pass has a precise starting list.
This sweep (grep for "Placeholder implementation" / "simulate" / "for demonstration" style comments)
was targeted, not exhaustive — `src/` has 1475+ public items across ~140 files, and dozens more
"simulate"/"for demonstration" comments exist that were not individually triaged (some are almost
certainly benign, e.g. doctest example values; others, especially in `feature/neural_features.rs`
and `feature/advanced_tracking.rs`, use "synthetic weights for demonstration" language that would
benefit from a dedicated follow-up stub-check pass).

Fresh test counts (2026-07-15, `cargo nextest run -p scirs2-vision` / `--all-features`): **1,341
passed, 4 skipped** (default features) / **1,345 passed, 4 skipped** (all-features).

## Status: v0.4.3 Released (May 3, 2026)

All v0.4.3 features are complete and production-ready. NeRF / Instant-NGP scene representation,
sparse-LiDAR depth completion, and temporal action segmentation are now stable across the
quality gate (cargo check + clippy clean).

## Known Issues

- SIFT descriptor computation is approximate; results may differ slightly from OpenCV reference
- Farneback optical flow requires grayscale input; color flow not yet supported
- ICP convergence is sensitive to initial alignment; RANSAC pre-alignment recommended for large misalignments
- Video stabilization requires sufficient texture in scene; textureless scenes may produce artifacts
- Panoptic segmentation API stabilized in v0.4.1; interface is now current and should not change without a deprecation cycle
- `streaming_modules::video_io::VideoStreamReader::from_source` returns a clear error for `VideoSource::VideoFile` ("Video file reading not yet implemented. Use image sequences instead.") and `VideoSource::Camera` ("Camera reading not yet implemented."). Only `VideoSource::ImageSequence` (a directory of image files) and `VideoSource::Dummy` (synthetic test source) are functional today. Real video-container decoding and camera capture would require a codec/camera integration (e.g. ffmpeg/gstreamer or a platform camera API), which is out of scope for the Pure Rust default build; frame-array-level processing (`video_processing.rs`, optical flow, stabilization, motion detection) works fine once frames are supplied as arrays.
