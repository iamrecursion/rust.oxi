# SciRS2 Development Roadmap

**Current Version**: 0.6.6
**Status**: Production Ready — v0.6.0 released 2026-07-01 (pure-Rust `oxicuda-*` CUDA stack as a direct, per-crate NVIDIA performance backend across 10 crates, decentralizing GPU out of `scirs2-core`; wgpu/WebGPU portability features standardized under a single `wgpu` name across the ecosystem); v0.6.1 released 2026-07-15 (real model-serving codegen, critical DLPack SIGBUS/stride fixes, honest GPU-dispatch and hardware-detection reporting, wgpu adapter discovery restricted to `Backends::PRIMARY`, F-distribution ppf, spatial hamming distance, finance facades, and dependency hardening (oxiarc-archive 0.3.6, oxicuda-* 0.5.0) — see CHANGELOG.md `[0.6.1]`); v0.6.2 released 2026-07-22 (Pure Rust hardening — real oxih5-backed HDF5 replacing the C-linked `hdf5` crate and the in-tree `hdf5_lite` reader, with a critical silent-data-loss fix; removed `libnuma`/`tracy-client`/`opencl3` C dependencies; honest `NumaTopology::detect()` in scirs2-spatial replacing a fabricated estimate; BREAKING TLS hardening (`rustls-no-provider` + auto-installed pure-Rust `oxitls-rustcrypto-provider`); Cranelift 0.134 bump fixing a `memmap2` unsound advisory — see CHANGELOG.md `[0.6.2]`); v0.6.3 released 2026-07-27 (Windows-compatibility hardening — fixed heap-corruption-on-free in scirs2-spatial/scirs2-stats, stack-overflow in scirs2-symbolic's `EmlNode` drop glue, a ~5.5GB-eager-allocation process abort in scirs2-transform, and a path validator rejecting every absolute Windows path in scirs2-core; plus ESPRIT/N4SID numerical-correctness fixes in scirs2-signal; oxifft/oxicuda/oxiz dependency bumps — see CHANGELOG.md `[0.6.3]`); v0.6.4 released 2026-07-28 (wasm32 follow-up fix — `oxifft` 0.4.1's hard `compile_error!` for its `threading` feature on `wasm32` targets is now resolved via target-gated dependencies in scirs2-fft/scirs2-signal, letting scirs2-wasm and the scirs2 meta-crate resume publishing after being skipped from 0.6.3 — see CHANGELOG.md `[0.6.4]`); v0.6.5 released 2026-07-31 (a defect-hunting cycle: a workspace-wide `#[ignore]`-legitimacy audit of all 132 previously-ignored tests surfaced and fixed real bugs across autograd, linalg, neural, stats, graph, io, integrate, series, spatial, ndimage and special — most notably that `scirs2-autograd`'s live backward pass silently identity-passed-through the majority of its operators (58/281 recognized) instead of computing their real gradients; `scirs2-signal` also had ~167 unreachable/duplicate files removed and 83 real-but-orphaned files (Kalman family, BSS/ICA, compressed sensing, STFT) wired back in — see CHANGELOG.md `[0.6.5]`)
**Scale**: ~4.19M lines total, ~3.07M Rust SLoC, ~8,018 Rust source files, ~29 workspace crates
**Last Updated**: 2026-07-31

This document tracks the development roadmap for SciRS2. Completed items in v0.3.4 are documented here for historical reference; the active roadmap is the v0.4.0 section.

> **NVIDIA/CUDA validation:** real-hardware validation of the oxicuda CUDA paths is tracked in [`TODO_CUDA.md`](./TODO_CUDA.md). **First-ever validation done 2026-06-29 on an NVIDIA RTX A4000 (sm_86, CUDA 12.4):** all 10 oxicuda CUDA paths now execute correctly on-device. The first run exposed 4 oxicuda root causes (a GEMM f64-PTX + launch-geometry bug; an SpMV PTX label/`shfl.b64` bug; and — notably — two *silent stub* kernels: a no-op Cholesky factorization and a comment-only depthwise conv), all fixed and re-verified. See `TODO_CUDA.md` for the sign-off matrix and remaining latent follow-ups.

### Pure Rust Policy Enforcement and Dependency Cleanup

#### Completed in v0.3.4
- [x] Removed `ndarray-npy` from scirs2-core — eliminated `zip` crate from dependency tree entirely
- [x] Removed unused workspace deps: `x509-parser`, `itertools`, `num-rational`, `gmp-mpfr-sys`
- [x] Removed unused OTel deps: `opentelemetry-prometheus`, `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`
- [x] Removed unused scirs2-io stubs: `mongodb`, `redis`, `prost` (direct dep)
- [x] Fixed dangling feature refs: `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions` in scirs2-core `instrumentation` feature, `itertools` in scirs2-graph

#### Transitive Policy Violations (indirect deps from external crates)
These are pulled in by external crates we depend on — not direct violations, but targets for future Pure Rust replacements:

- [x] `flate2` + `zlib-rs` — pulled in transitively by:
  - `parquet` (scirs2-io) — flate2 for Parquet compression
  - `png` / `tiff` (image crate) — flate2 for image codec
  - `ureq` (scirs2-datasets) — flate2 for HTTP content encoding
  - **Action**: Evaluate Pure Rust Parquet alternatives or contribute upstream patches; for image/ureq these are internal to the crate and not directly replaceable
- [x] `snap` (Snappy) — pulled in by `parquet`
  - **Action**: Feature-gate `parquet` support so users who don't need it avoid these deps
- [x] `prost` (transitive) — pulled in by `opentelemetry-otlp` (scirs2-core)
  - **Action**: Consider whether OTel OTLP export is needed; if not, remove `opentelemetry-otlp` or feature-gate it

#### Barely-Used Dependencies (audit candidates)
- [x] `ureq` (8 uses) — overlaps with `reqwest` (80+ uses); consolidate HTTP client to one
- [x] `cron` (4 uses) — ensure properly feature-gated, not pulled into default builds
- [x] `opentelemetry_sdk` (4 uses) — verify necessity; most OTel setup is stub code
- [x] `num_bigint` (4 uses) — verify `arbitrary-precision` feature is not in default features
- [x] `egui` / `eframe` (~40 uses) — GUI deps; ensure feature-gated (visualization only)

#### Dead Code Cleanup
- [x] Audit `scirs2-core` JIT module — Cranelift crates removed but JIT stub code may remain in `array_protocol/jit_impl.rs`
- [x] Audit `scirs2-io` mongodb/redis feature stubs — feature names kept but deps removed; clean up cfg blocks if they contain only stub code
- [x] Audit `array_io` feature in scirs2-core — ndarray-npy removed; feature now only gates `["std", "array"]` which may be redundant

#### Dependency Reduction Goals for v0.4.0
- [x] Reduce total workspace dependency count by 15-20%
- [x] Ensure all default feature sets are 100% Pure Rust (no C/Fortran transitive deps)
- [x] Run `cargo tree --workspace --all-features -d` regularly to detect unnecessary version duplicates
- [x] Implement `cargo-scirs2-policy` linter check for banned direct deps (zip, flate2, bincode, openblas, etc.)

### Infrastructure and Tooling
- [x] WebGPU backend for scirs2-wasm (browser-side GPU compute via WebGPU API)
- [x] Python PyPI wheel distribution via maturin (Linux/macOS/Windows wheels)
- [x] mdBook documentation website with interactive examples and tutorials
- [x] Comprehensive benchmark regression suite (criterion-based with CI integration)
- [x] Jupyter notebook examples via evcxr Rust kernel
- [x] cargo-scirs2-policy linter: detect direct `use rand::*` / `use ndarray::` in non-core crates
- [x] Cross-platform Windows test suite improvements (full parity with Linux/macOS)
- [x] Julia binding improvements: JLL-based distribution for easier Julia package installation
- [x] Protocol buffer schema registry integration for scirs2-io

---

## v0.4.4 — RELEASED (May 15, 2026)

**Centerpiece**: `scirs2-symbolic` is now a complete EML-IR-native CAS substrate with seamless `scirs2-autograd` integration and a real OxiZ-backed SMT layer. See `scirs2-symbolic/TODO.md` for the per-phase status grid.

### scirs2-symbolic — Phase 0 (Substrate) — COMPLETE (13/13, Wave 53)
- [x] `eml::tree` Arc-shared `EmlNode` / `EmlTree` with thread-local hash-cons (u128 structural hash)
- [x] `eml::canonical` — 27 canonical EML constructors covering every elementary function
- [x] `eml::op` + `eml::lower` — `LoweredOp` flat IR with `OxiOp` stack-machine tape; `lower`/`raise`
- [x] `eml::parser` + `eml::display::to_latex` — text round-trip + LaTeX export with π/e exact-match
- [x] `eml::eval` — iterative stack-machine real + complex evaluator; stack-safe on 543-deep canonical sin
- [x] `eml::simplify` — fixed-point rewrite (constant folding, identity rules, inverse cancellation, hash-based commutative ordering)
- [x] `eml::grad` — symbolic gradient; `grad`, `grad_all`, `jacobian`, `hessian` all public
- [x] `eml::interval` — outward-rounded interval arithmetic with monotone-region splitting
- [x] `eml::bridge` — `Expr ↔ LoweredOp` adapter with deterministic `VarMap`
- [x] oxieml v0.1.0 parity test harness at 1e-9 tolerance (`tests/oxieml_parity.rs`)
- [x] OxiZ workspace dep registered (`oxiz = "0.2.1"` behind `smt` feature)
- [x] ADR-0001: clean-room native EML implementation
- [x] Cycle-prevention CI gate (`scripts/check-no-symbolic-in-core.sh`)

### scirs2-symbolic — Phase 1 (Native API) — 11/13 (Waves 54–56)
- [x] `regression::discover` ndarray API (SR engine, Config builder, Pareto front)
- [x] `regression::discover_multi` for vector-valued targets
- [x] `regression::discover_ode` SINDy-style API

- [x] Python bindings (`scirs2-python::symbolic`)
- [x] Physics examples (4 examples)
- [x] Integration test suite (~564 `#[test]` markers across the crate)

- [x] **`docs/cas_tutorial.md` end-to-end walkthrough** (planned 2026-05-15) (DONE Wave 75, 2026-05-15 — docs/cas_tutorial.md 1488 lines; primary verification at scirs2-symbolic/tests/cas_tutorial_compile.rs with 13 #[test] functions, one per section)
  - **Goal:** A 1000-1500-line tutorial markdown that walks a new user through using `scirs2-symbolic` from raw parsing to JIT-compiled execution, exercising every Phase-2 entry-point. Becomes the canonical "how to use the CAS" reference for v0.5.0.
  - **Design:** 13-section structure covering: EML substrate, parsing/pretty-printing, canonicalization, identity DB + SMT (OxiZ NLSAT 0.2.1 limitation noted), cas::solve (linear/poly/system/ODE), integrate_rational (Risch-LITE), GradGraph differentiation, Cranelift JIT, GPU WGSL codegen, Python+WASM bindings, cross-crate integration (optimize::symbolic::newton), diffgeom Schwarzschild Ricci scalar, reference and next-steps.
  - **Files:** `docs/cas_tutorial.md` (new, ~1200 lines); `scirs2-symbolic/tests/cas_tutorial_compile.rs` (new, ≥13 `#[test]` functions, one per tutorial section).
  - **Tests:** `cargo nextest run -p scirs2-symbolic --test cas_tutorial_compile` — ≥13 tests pass. This is the PRIMARY harness (doc lives outside crate; `cargo test --doc` can't reach it).
  - **Risk:** API drift between Wave 70 and 75 could invalidate samples; `tests/cas_tutorial_compile.rs` is the single source of truth.

## Policy References

All development must adhere to the following policies:

- **No unwrap() Policy**: No `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code; use `?` and proper error handling
- **Pure Rust Policy**: Default feature set must be 100% Pure Rust (no C/Fortran); optional C-backed features must be feature-gated
- **COOLJAPAN Ecosystem Policy**: Use OxiBLAS (not OpenBLAS/MKL), OxiFFT (not rustfft/FFTW), oxiarc-* (not zip), oxicode (not bincode)
- **Workspace Policy**: All crate versions use `*.workspace = true`; no per-crate version declarations (except keywords/categories)
- **File Size Policy**: No single file > 2000 lines; use `splitrs` for refactoring (installed at `~/work/splitrs/`)
- **Naming Convention**: `snake_case` for all variables, functions, modules; `CamelCase` for types and traits
- **SciRS2 POLICY**: All non-core crates must use `scirs2-core` abstractions for rand/ndarray/num_complex access

**Last Updated**: 2026-07-28
**Branch**: 0.6.5
**Status**: v0.6.5 (current) — the 0.6.x series introduces the pure-Rust `oxicuda-*` CUDA stack as a direct, per-crate NVIDIA performance backend across 10 crates (fft/symbolic/interpolate/special/stats/graph/linalg/optimize/datasets/vision), decentralizing GPU out of `scirs2-core`. Two GPU stories now stand side by side: wgpu/WebGPU portability (retained in core as `GpuNdarray`/`WebGPUContext`) and `oxicuda-*` performance (NVIDIA-only, f64-capable, real CUDA PTX→driver JIT). Standardized every real wgpu portability feature across the ecosystem under a single `wgpu` name; retired core's cudarc-based CUDA backend entirely (Pure-Rust win). See CHANGELOG.md `[0.6.0]` for the CUDA-decentralization release notes, `[0.6.1]` (2026-07-15) for the follow-up hardening pass — real model-serving codegen, a critical DLPack SIGBUS fix, and honest GPU-dispatch reporting — `[0.6.2]` (2026-07-22) for the Pure Rust hardening pass: real oxih5-backed HDF5, removal of the `libnuma`/`tracy-client`/`opencl3` C dependencies, honest NUMA topology detection, and BREAKING TLS-provider hardening — `[0.6.3]` (2026-07-27) for Windows-compatibility hardening: heap-corruption, stack-overflow, and process-abort fixes plus ESPRIT/N4SID numerical-correctness fixes — and `[0.6.4]` (2026-07-28) for the wasm32 follow-up fix: target-gated `oxifft` dependencies in scirs2-fft/scirs2-signal resolving a hard `compile_error!` on `threading` + `wasm32`, letting scirs2-wasm/scirs2 resume publishing.

---

## Wave 72 (May 2026)
- [x] scirs2-special: `erfc_batch_wgpu` + `ERFC_WGSL` (complementary error function, hard clamp |x|>6); `erfinv_batch_wgpu` + `ERFINV_WGSL` (Winitzki 2008 rational approximation); both re-exported from `gpu_kernels` and routed through `batch_erfc`/`batch_erfinv` in `gpu_dispatch.rs`; 2 new integration tests added to `tests/gpu_wgpu_dispatch.rs`
- [x] scirs2-fft: `fft_wgpu()` fully implemented — multi-pass Cooley-Tukey radix-2 DIT dispatch via wgpu; bit-reverse permutation, per-stage uniform-buffer update, graceful skip when no adapter; roundtrip and non-power-of-two tests
- [x] scirs2-stats: new `gpu` module (`src/gpu/mod.rs`) with batch WGSL compute shaders for Normal log-PDF, Normal CDF, Exponential log-PDF, Exponential CDF; `MIN_GPU_SIZE=1024` threshold ensures small arrays always use CPU (f64 precision); `gpu` and `gpu_wgpu` feature flags; all tests pass

---

## Wave 71 (May 2026)
- [x] scirs2-special: `wgpu_kernels` feature — real wgpu dispatch for `gamma_batch_wgpu`, `erf_batch_wgpu`, `bessel_j0_batch_wgpu`; new `lgamma_batch_wgpu` + `LGAMMA_WGSL` shader; integration test suite (5 tests, graceful skip when no adapter)
- [x] scirs2-core: WGSL compute shaders for `ElementwiseSub/Mul/Div/Pow/Sqrt/Exp/Log` kernels — registry-path wgpu now covers all common elementwise ops; new smoke tests verify shader compile and workgroup layout
- [x] scirs2-transform: `GpuPCA::fit/transform/fit_transform` now CPU-backed via `reduction::PCA` (SVD); 18 functional tests replace 5 stub tests; `GpuPCA` no longer returns `NotImplemented`

---

## /stub-check 2026-05-05 — Deferred items

These stubs were discovered by /stub-check but deferred because they require external SDKs, major new subsystems (>5000 LoC), or have dedicated planned waves.

### GPU backends (Pure Rust Policy: no CUDA/Metal/OpenCL/Vulkan SDKs)
- [x] `scirs2-core/src/gpu/kernels/elementwise.rs` — WGSL filled in for `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `pow`, `sqrt`, `exp`, `log` (Wave 71)
- [x] `scirs2-special/src/gpu_kernels/` — wgpu dispatch wired for gamma/erf/bessel_j0/lgamma; `wgpu_kernels` feature (Wave 71)
- [x] `scirs2-transform/src/gpu.rs` — `GpuPCA::fit/transform/fit_transform` now CPU-backed via `reduction::PCA` (Wave 71)
- [ ] `scirs2-core/src/gpu/` — remaining kernel stubs (large scope; partial wgpu coverage now in place)
- [x] `scirs2-stats/src/gpu/` — GPU-backed statistical operations (Normal/Exponential log-PDF and CDF batch; MIN_GPU_SIZE=1024 threshold; Wave 72)
- [x] `scirs2-fft/src/gpu_fft/wgpu_backend.rs` — `fft_wgpu()` multi-pass Cooley-Tukey DIT; graceful adapter-missing skip (Wave 72)
- [ ] `scirs2-fft/src/backends/{cuda,metal}.rs` — CUDA/Metal FFT backends
- [x] `scirs2-interpolate/src/gpu_accelerated/` — Real wgpu RBF kernel-matrix + evaluation dispatch (Wave 75)
  - Split into mod.rs (CPU types, GpuStats, struct, dispatch logic) + wgpu_rbf.rs (WGSL shaders, GPU pipeline)
  - `wgpu_rbf` feature gate; GPU threshold n_centers*n_queries>=4096; real GpuStats with measured cpu_time_ns/gpu_dispatch_ns/transfer_ns/used_gpu; f64→f32 cast documented; OnceLock<bool> GPU probe cache
  - 5 smoke tests in scirs2-interpolate/tests/wgpu_rbf_smoke.rs; all 1147 tests pass with wgpu_rbf feature
- [x] `scirs2-graph/src/gpu/algorithms.rs` — GPU graph algorithms (already CPU-parallel; wgpu dispatch future) (planned 2026-05-25)
  - **Goal:** Real wgpu BFS + Bellman-Ford SSSP + delta-stepping; CpuParallel branch fixed to call parallel_bfs_atomic
  - **Design:** WGSL bfs_frontier (level-sync, atomicCompareExchange on distances array<atomic<i32>>); sssp_bellman_ford (edge-parallel atomicMin, f32 weights); sssp_delta_stepping (dispatches Bellman-Ford GPU kernel; true bucket-based delta-stepping deferred to Wave 76); parallel_bellman_ford_atomic via AtomicU32 (f32::to_bits trick for non-negative weights); n_edges<4096 CPU threshold
  - **Files:** scirs2-graph/src/gpu/algorithms.rs, scirs2-graph/src/gpu/parallel.rs (new), scirs2-graph/src/gpu/wgpu_shaders.rs (new), scirs2-graph/Cargo.toml (extend gpu feature with dep:wgpu/pollster/bytemuck), scirs2-graph/tests/wgpu_graph_smoke.rs (new)
  - **Tests:** bfs_gpu_matches_cpu_or_skips, sssp_bellman_ford_gpu_matches_cpu_or_skips, cpu_parallel_bfs_actually_parallel, delta_stepping_matches_bellman_ford_or_skips (4 tests gated on cfg(feature = "gpu") with adapter skip) — all pass 1422/1422
  - **Result:** CpuParallel branches now call parallel_bfs_atomic/parallel_bellman_ford_atomic; GPU branches dispatch wgpu shaders with CPU fallback; 0 clippy warnings
- [ ] `scirs2-optimize/src/gpu/` + `distributed_gpu.rs` — GPU optimization

### Distributed computing (requires external MPI/RDMA runtime)
- [ ] `scirs2-linalg/src/distributed/communication.rs` — MPI-backed distributed communication
- [ ] `scirs2-autograd/src/distributed/communication.rs` — MPI-backed autograd communication

### Architectural / large scope
- [ ] `scirs2-core/src/advanced_cloud_storage/providers.rs` — Azure Blob + AWS-specific backends (requires cloud SDKs)
- [ ] `scirs2-core/src/memory_efficient/cross_device.rs` — TPU support (no Pure Rust path)
- [x] `scirs2-core/src/array_protocol/operations.rs` — 15 protocol stubs (matmul/svd/inverse/transpose/reshape etc.) — architectural, backend dispatch (planned 2026-05-25)
  - **Goal:** GpuNdarray<T: GpuScalar> implementing ArrayProtocol::array_function for 14 registered ops (10 wgpu, 4 CPU fallback with documented reason)
  - **Design:** Struct with Arc<wgpu::Buffer>+shape+strides+Arc<WebGPUContext>; GpuScalar sealed for f32; elementwise_binary.wgsl (op_id uniform, 256,1,1); matmul_tiled.wgsl (16×16 shared-memory); reduce_sum.wgsl (two-pass); transpose_tiled.wgsl (32×32 bank-conflict-padded); concatenate axis=0 via copy_buffer_to_buffer; reshape = zero-copy Arc clone; svd/inverse/apply_elementwise/axised-sum → CPU fallback with mandatory comment; operations.rs dispatch hooks at lines 82,224,356,488,620,680,743,780,850,927,984,1033,1084,1135
  - **Files:** scirs2-core/src/array_protocol/gpu_ndarray.rs (new ~1100 LoC), scirs2-core/src/array_protocol/operations.rs (extend ~200 LoC), scirs2-core/src/array_protocol/mod.rs (pub mod gpu_ndarray gated), scirs2-core/tests/gpu_ndarray_dispatch_smoke.rs (new)
  - **Tests:** gpu_ndarray_add_matches_cpu_or_skips, gpu_ndarray_matmul_matches_cpu_or_skips, gpu_ndarray_sum_full_reduction, gpu_ndarray_transpose_2d, gpu_ndarray_reshape_is_zero_copy, gpu_ndarray_concatenate_axis0, gpu_ndarray_svd_falls_back_to_cpu_with_note, gpu_dispatch_below_threshold_uses_cpu (8 tests gated on cfg(feature = "array_protocol_wgpu") with adapter skip)
  - **Risk:** Matmul f32 tolerance 1e-4; concatenate axis>0 deferred to Wave 76 with CPU fallback + doc note
- [x] `scirs2-neural/src/serving.rs` — `generate_binary` / `generate_shared_library` (runtime codegen via rustc, oversized) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** Both functions produce **genuine** artifacts for the host target — a real native executable and a real `cdylib` (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`) — not the current placeholder magic-byte writes. `serving.rs` becomes a live, compiled, tested module. Non-host `TargetPlatform` variants return an honest error, not a fake file. The full 10-platform cross-compilation matrix is deferred to `## Proposed follow-ups` as genuinely oversized.
  - **Design:**
    - **Precondition — un-orphan `serving.rs`:** add `pub mod serving;` to `scirs2-neural/src/lib.rs` (beside `serialization` / `export`). Fix the commented import at `serving.rs:13` — wire model persistence to the real SafeTensors path (`ModelSerialize::save`/`load`) rather than the legacy `save_model`/`load_model` (which are `#[cfg(feature="legacy_serialization")]`); if SafeTensors reconstruction of a full `Sequential<F>` is not available, feature-gate the serving module's persistence on `legacy_serialization` instead of hard-breaking. The whole file must compile clean under `-D warnings`.
    - **Honest sibling stubs:** the other `generate_*` methods that write fake magic bytes (`generate_wasm_module`, `generate_android_aar`, `generate_ios_framework`, `generate_python_wheel`) must NOT ship as live code that emits bogus artifacts once the module is un-orphaned. Convert each to return a clear `NeuralError` ("… packaging not yet implemented") — honest, no `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()`, no fake bytes, won't trip `/stub-check`. The real C/JS/Java/Swift/Python **source** emitters already produce valid output — leave those intact.
    - **Codegen pipeline (host target):** (1) serialize the `Sequential<F>` model + architecture to a temp dir (`std::env::temp_dir()` join a unique subdir); (2) emit a real Cargo project — `Cargo.toml` (path-dep on this local `scirs2-neural`; `crate-type=["cdylib"]` for the shared-lib case) plus `main.rs` (binary: load model, read stdin/argv input, run `forward`, print) or `lib.rs` (`#[no_mangle] extern "C"` wrappers matching the existing `generate_c_header` ABI: `scirs2_model_load`/`scirs2_model_predict`/`scirs2_model_free`); (3) shell out via `std::process::Command` to `cargo build --release` (or `rustc` for the trivial case), capture stderr, map failures to `NeuralError`; (4) copy the produced artifact to the caller's `path`. Guard: if `platform` != detected host, return `NeuralError` (unsupported cross-target) — do not fabricate.
    - No `unwrap()`; all `Command`/`fs` results via `?` / `map_err`.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-neural/src/serving.rs` (implement 2 fns, honest-error the 4 sibling stubs, fix imports), `scirs2-neural/src/lib.rs` (`pub mod serving;`). Possibly a small `serving/codegen.rs` split if `serving.rs` crosses 2000 lines after the work (use `splitrs`).
  - **Prerequisites (build them):** un-orphan + compile-fix the module; wire real serialization. These are in-scope per IMPLEMENT POLICY, not blockers.
  - **Tests:** (a) unit tests on the source-emission helpers (generated `Cargo.toml` / `main.rs` / `lib.rs` strings contain the right crate-type, ABI symbols, we-file path — no compiler needed, fast); (b) one end-to-end test that actually invokes `rustc` on a minimal **std-only** generated program in a temp dir and runs it, asserting exit-0 + expected stdout (proves the compile-and-run pipeline without a multi-minute dependent build) — gate on `rustc` being resolvable so it skips gracefully if absent; (c) host-vs-non-host guard test asserting a non-host `TargetPlatform` returns `Err`. Do NOT run a full `cargo build` of a scirs2-neural-dependent temp project in the standard test path (too slow/fragile). No `#[ignore]`.
  - **Risk:** Un-orphaning WIP drags previously-dead code into the 0.6.1 build; the file may have further compile issues beyond the known import. Mitigation: the subagent must reach a clean `cargo build -p scirs2-neural --all-features` + `cargo clippy … -D warnings` before flipping `[x]`; if the orphaned module proves to have deep unrelated breakage, return `status: deviated` with specifics rather than force it — the orchestrator will surface it (parent /nagare authorized honest escalation for this item).

### Specialized algorithms (dedicated future waves)
- [x] ~~`scirs2-integrate/src/dae/solvers.rs:833` — Pantelides DAE index reduction~~ (DONE Wave 73, 2026-05-08)
- [x] ~~`scirs2-integrate/src/sde/runge_kutta_sde.rs:59` — SDE iterated stochastic integrals (Lévy-area approximation)~~ (DONE Wave 73, 2026-05-08)
- [x] **Distributed FFT for 4D+ arrays via slab + pencil + volumetric decomposition** (planned 2026-05-15) (DONE Wave 75, 2026-05-15 — slab/pencil/volumetric helpers in scirs2-fft/src/distributed.rs; 3 integration tests at scirs2-fft/tests/distributed_{4d_slab,5d_pencil,volumetric_nd}.rs)
  - **Goal:** Replace the three unimplemented stubs at `scirs2-fft/src/distributed.rs` (return `FFTError::DimensionError("Dimensions higher than 3 not yet implemented")`) with real slab (4D), pencil (5D), and volumetric (n-D) decompositions.
  - **Design:** Slab for 4D: split axis 0 into n_workers equal slabs; local `fftn_3d` on each slab; alltoall transpose; FFT axis 0. Pencil for 5D: 2D process grid on axes 0+1; local FFT axes 2-4; two alltoall rotations. Volumetric for n-D: recursive transpose-and-FFT splitting the first `ceil(log2(n_workers))` axes. Pure Rust (no MPI). API: `pub fn fftn_distributed<F, D: ndarray::Dimension>(input, axes, workers: Option<usize>) -> FftResult<...>`.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-fft/src/distributed.rs` (replace 3 unimplemented stubs); `scirs2-fft/src/lib.rs` (re-export); optional split-out submodules if > 2000 LoC.
  - **Tests:** `tests/distributed_4d_slab.rs`, `tests/distributed_5d_pencil.rs`, `tests/distributed_volumetric_nd.rs` (6D+7D, dims ≤ 8); each includes a round-trip test.
  - **Risk:** Memory (cap dim ≤ 8 in tests); uneven worker blocks (use truncated sizes, no padding).
- [x] **n-D Voronoi cell vertex + volume computation** (planned 2026-05-15) (DONE Wave 75, 2026-05-15 — vertices_nd/volume_nd/neighbours_nd on VoronoiCell; scirs2-spatial Bowyer-Watson dependency; 4 test files; 4D expensive tests gated #[ignore])
  - **Goal:** Extend `scirs2-interpolate/src/voronoi/voronoi_cell.rs` from 2D/3D-approximation to genuine n-D (n ≥ 2). Add cell-vertex enumeration, cell-volume computation, and neighbour-finding up to 6D.
  - **Design:** Vertices = circumcentres of Delaunay (n+1)-simplices adjacent to each site (solve (n+1)×(n+1) linear system per simplex). Cell volume = convex hull of vertices via Cayley-Menger determinant / QuickHull + simplex-volume sum. Re-use `scirs2-spatial::delaunay::DelaunayTriangulation` (nD Bowyer-Watson, f64, runtime-dim dispatch). API: `VoronoiCell<F>::vertices() -> Vec<Array1<F>>`, `volume() -> F`, `neighbours() -> Vec<usize>`.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-interpolate/src/voronoi/voronoi_cell.rs` (extend); `scirs2-interpolate/src/voronoi/mod.rs` (re-export). Splitrs if > 2000 LoC.
  - **Tests:** `tests/voronoi_3d_cube.rs`, `tests/voronoi_4d_hypercube.rs`, `tests/voronoi_5d_random_sites.rs` (32 pts, volumes sum = bbox volume ±1e-8), `tests/voronoi_neighbours_2d.rs` (backward-compat).
  - **Risk:** Degenerate (co-circular) sites → ε-perturbation; curse of dimensionality → cap 5D in CI.
- [x] `scirs2-linalg/src/autograd/tensor_algebra.rs:249,509` — General tensor contraction (Einstein summation engine) [implemented in `src/autograd/einsum.rs`; 13 tests pass]
- [x] **Gauss-Legendre quadrature orders 4-10 for volume-preserving integrators** (planned 2026-05-16) — *workspace `TODO.md` L864 (DG/spectral/volume-preserving sub-item)*
  - **Goal:** Replace the early-error path at `scirs2-integrate/src/geometric/volume_preserving.rs:590` (`n_quad ≥ 4 → return Err`) with a real implementation supplying Gauss-Legendre nodes + weights for orders n = 1..=10 with exactness for polynomials of degree 2n-1 on [-1, 1].
  - **Design:** Hardcoded double-precision tables (Abramowitz & Stegun / SciPy leggauss) for n ∈ {4..10}; single match dispatch; n=0 and n>10 return IntegrateError::InvalidArgument. No new cross-crate deps.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-integrate/src/geometric/volume_preserving.rs` (lines ~580-650); new `scirs2-integrate/tests/volume_preserving_high_order_quadrature.rs`.
  - **Tests:** 5 tests — exactness for k=0..2n-1, node antisymmetry, weight sum = 2, invalid order errors, IRK-Gauss pendulum Hamiltonian drift ≤ 1e-10 for 1000 steps.
  - **Risk:** transcription errors caught by polynomial-exactness test.

- [x] **Discontinuous Galerkin solver for 1D compressible Euler with HLLC Riemann flux + slope-limiter, validated against Sod shock tube** (completed 2026-05-16) — *workspace `TODO.md` L864*
  - **Goal:** New `scirs2-integrate/src/pde/dg_systems/` module; nodal DG with GLL nodes + HLLC flux + SSPRK3 time integrator + MinmodTvbLimiter; Sod shock tube L1 error ≤ 5e-2 at p=2/N=200.
  - **Design:** `euler_1d.rs` (EulerState/EulerFlux/primitives_to_conservative); `hllc_euler.rs` (Toro HLLC, Davis-Einfeldt wave speeds); `dg_system_solver.rs` (DgSystemConfig, DgSystemSolution, solve_1d_euler_dg, GLL nodes from dg_advanced::entropy_stable); `limiter.rs` (SlopeLimiter trait, MinmodTvbLimiter, StandardPerssonPeraire); SSPRK3/SSPRK4 added to ode/methods/explicit.rs. Sequential sub-steps: B0 SSPRK prerequisite → B1 state/flux → B2 limiter → B3 solver → B4 tests/example/wiring.
  - **Files:** 5 new files under `src/pde/dg_systems/`; `src/pde/mod.rs`; `src/lib.rs`; `src/ode/methods/explicit.rs`; `examples/sod_shock_tube_dg.rs`; 2 new test files.
  - **Tests:** 5 Sod-tube tests (L1 errors p=2/3/4, conservation, positivity); 9 convergence-order tests (3 orders × 3 mesh sizes); 16 in-module unit tests.
  - **Risk:** Gibbs oscillations without limiting (MinmodTvbLimiter default); CFL positivity failure (fallback cfl=0.3).
- [x] `scirs2-neural/src/models/architectures/mamba.rs` — Mamba SSM (implemented — 983 lines, full selective scan + ZOH discretization)
- [x] ~~`scirs2-neural/src/models/diffusion/dpm_solver.rs` — DPM-Solver (dedicated wave planned)~~ (DONE Wave 73, 2026-05-08)

#### Wave 75 (2026-05-25)
- [x] `scirs2-interpolate` RBF wgpu — real WGSL kernel-matrix+eval (kernel_id uniform, workgroup 16×16/64); OnceLock GPU probe cache; 5 smoke tests

- [x] `scirs2-core` `GpuNdarray<f32>` — 7 WGSL kernels (elementwise add/sub/mul/scalar, naive matmul, two-pass sum, 16×16 transpose); singleton WebGPUContext; CPU fallback for svd/inverse; `array_protocol_wgpu` feature; 8 smoke tests

#### Wave 76 (2026-05-25)
- [x] `scirs2-core/gpu/kernels/mod.rs` — 13 empty WGSL slots filled (Adam/SGD/RMSprop/Adagrad/LAMB/memcpy/fill/reduce_sum/reduce_max/rk4_stages/rk4_combine/error_estimate); 4 smoke tests
- [x] `scirs2-optimize` L-BFGS GPU — `lbfgs_gpu.rs` two-loop recursion via GpuNdarray; `GpuLbfgsState`; f64↔f32 boundary; GPU_LBFGS_THRESHOLD=4096; 2 smoke tests

#### Wave 78 (2026-06-13) — /cooljapan-stub-check batch (11 implemented, 4 deferred)
- [x] `scirs2-integrate` petrov_galerkin.rs re-enabled — 19 mechanical fixes (underscore field shorthands `GLS { _tau }`→`{ tau }`, composite indices `i_j`→`[i, j]`, tuple destructure) **plus** real defects: rewrote `apply_boundary_conditions` to the geometry-based `BoundaryCondition` API (Dirichlet/Neumann/Robin/Periodic), switched `Custom` variant to `Arc<dyn Fn>` + manual Debug; `pub mod` + re-exports; 3 petrov tests + full 1803-test suite green, clippy clean
- [x] `scirs2-neural` sequential tests (`StdRng`→`SmallRng`) + all 5 architecture examples (vit/bert/convnext/mobilenet/transformer) un-commented, auto-discovered, and runnable (exit 0). Fixed real library bugs surfaced by the examples: 3D-tensor `Dense` flatten in ViT/BERT FFN, MobileNet residual indexing + classifier channel count, Conv2D `Same`-padding per-side-vs-total. Transformer example adapted to real `encoder().forward`/`forward_train`/`forward_inference` API. 1769-test suite green, clippy clean
- [x] `scirs2-ndimage` quantum_consciousness wired to the real `neural_processing::reorganize_network_structure` (`pub(crate)`; dead duplicate removed); `apply_temporal_causal_inference` implemented (Granger-style causal propagation over `causal_graph`/`temporal_memory` with exp temporal decay) + wired into `simulate_quantum_consciousness`; 3 new tests; 1170-test suite green, clippy clean
- [x] `scirs2-series` cloud_deployment_demo example re-enabled against the already-complete `src/cloud_deployment.rs` (API matched exactly; one unused import dropped); runs all 4 demos (15 jobs) under `--features wasm`, default build green
- [x] `scirs2-text` pos_tagging_original_tests — root cause was a **stale TODO**: the suite was already wired via an in-module `#[path]` include in `pos_tagging_original.rs` and passing; declaring it at crate root would have double-compiled and broken it. Corrected the lib.rs comment + removed a duplicate `use super::*`; 26 pos tests + 1717-test suite green, clippy clean
- [x] `scirs2-core` mixed_precision batch execution now works on stable Rust — added `MixedPrecisionSupport::as_array_protocol` bridge (avoids unstable `trait_upcasting`) + fixed 2 latent operand/result dispatch bugs so it actually computes; new `GpuDevice::get_info()` + `GpuDeviceInfo` (`src/gpu/device_info.rs`); `performance_optimization.rs:840` clippy `nonminimal_bool` macro false-positive fixed via let-binding; 3020-test suite green, clippy clean (default + gpu)
- [x] `scirs2-io` gpu/backend_management real device-capability validation via `scirs2_core::gpu::GpuDevice::get_info()` (per-backend fp64/fp16/memory/workgroup checks, unknown(0)=skip); 6 new tests; 1244-test suite green, clippy clean (default + gpu)
- [x] `scirs2-datasets` generators GPU dispatch — new `gpu_dispatch.rs` + `gpu_wgpu` feature; classification/regression/blobs heavy linalg via `GpuNdarray` (matmul/add/scalar), threshold 4096, host-RNG-first for exact CPU equivalence (max diff ≤1.3e-7); 4 smoke tests (GPU adapter ran)
- [x] `scirs2-optimize` distributed_gpu — DE population fitness-reduction / donor matrix `a+F·(b−c)` / selection deltas via `GpuNdarray`; reuses `gpu` feature, threshold 4096; 9 new tests; 2006-test suite (gpu) green, clippy clean
- [x] `scirs2-vision` neural_operations GPU multi-head attention — root cause was a no-op `execute_kernel` stub whose output buffer was never read back; rewrote to the real `GpuContext` execute/compile + `copy_to_host` path with a stable-softmax WGSL compute shader (wgpu 29); `gpu` feature; 2 new tests; 1341-test suite green, clippy clean (default + gpu)
- Deferred (external SDK / upstream-blocked — Pure Rust policy): `scirs2-ndimage` native Metal backend (wgpu is the Pure-Rust path); `scirs2-sparse` `gpu/cuda.rs` CUDA SpMV (route via future wgpu SpMV wave); `scirs2-io` hdf5→oxih5 (blocked on oxih5 **write** support); `scirs2-core` numpy_compat zero-copy PyBuffer (opportunistic)
- Note: `scirs2-core::GpuContext::execute_kernel` remains a no-op stub; `scirs2-vision` neural_operations still has 2 more functions (`gpu_batch_matmul_transformer`, `gpu_feature_matching_advanced`) on that stale path — candidate follow-up wave.

### Planned
- [x] ~~Symbolic computing enhancements (Phase 4 diffgeom extensions)~~ (DONE Wave 72, 2026-05-07)
- [x] ~~NUMA scheduler public API (`scirs2-core::par_map_chunks` ecosystem-wide)~~ (DONE Wave 73, 2026-05-08)
- [x] ~~GPU WGSL JIT actual wgpu submission (deferred from v0.4.4)~~ (DONE Wave 75, 2026-05-25)
  - **Goal:** GpuKernel::eval_batch() actually dispatches to wgpu (replacing hardcoded Err("wired in v0.4.5")); to_jit_auto GPU_DISPATCH_THRESHOLD=100_000 becomes real dispatch
  - **Design:** Inline wgpu (adapter→device→pipeline→bind-group→dispatch→readback) in gpu.rs using scirs2-fft pattern; f64→f32 cast at upload, f32→f64 at readback; 2-binding layout (inputs read, outputs rw); dispatch ceil(n_rows/64) workgroups; GpuError extended with NoAdapter(String), EmptyInput, BufferError; GpuError::Unsupported removed from active path
  - **Files:** scirs2-symbolic/src/compile/gpu.rs (480→723 LoC), scirs2-symbolic/tests/wgpu_eval_batch_smoke.rs (new), scirs2-symbolic/tests/cas_tutorial_compile.rs (section_09 updated for Phase 2)
  - **Tests:** eval_batch_constant_kernel_or_skips, eval_batch_transcendental_kernel_or_skips, to_jit_auto_returns_gpu_above_threshold_or_skips, eval_batch_empty_input_is_always_error (4 tests, all pass)

- [x] **State-sync: flip Wave 75 `[~]` items to `[x]` + acknowledge finance pricing residue** (planned 2026-05-16)
  - **Goal:** Bring `TODO.md` in line with Wave 75 reality: flip the 3 Wave 75 `[~]` items (distributed FFT >3D, Voronoi nD, cas_tutorial) to `[x]`; add finance-pricing acceptance note.
  - **Design:** Find and flip the three `[~]` plan blocks for Wave 75 Slices 3/4/5 to `[x]` with DONE annotations. Append a note under a `## Notes` section (creating one if absent) about the Wave 75 finance-pricing code (+913 LoC SABR/Hull-White/Bates/LocalVolatility) accepted and retained.
  - **Files:** `TODO.md` only.
  - **Tests:** none required.

## Proposed follow-ups

- [x] Wave 76 Refinement A: scirs2-core/gpu WGSL kernel stubs filled (Adam/SGD/RMSprop/Adagrad/LAMB/memcpy/fill/reduce_sum/reduce_max/rk4_stages/rk4_combine/error_estimate — 13 kernels, 4 smoke tests) (2026-05-25)
- [x] Wave 76 Refinement B: L-BFGS 2-loop recursion GPU-accelerated via GpuNdarray (dot products + vector ops; f64→f32 boundary; GPU_LBFGS_THRESHOLD=4096; 2 smoke tests; CPU path unchanged) (2026-05-25)
- [x] Wave 76 Refinement C(i): SR-as-prior time-series — discover_series_prior (sliding-window feature matrix → SR discovery), eval_series_prior, series_prior_regularization (min-over-formulas penalty); SymbolicPriorLoss in scirs2-neural; 8 tests (2026-05-25)

### Wave 75 Refinement A — Enumerate remaining scirs2-core/gpu stubs
~~Propose Wave 76 stub-check: scan scirs2-core/src/gpu/**/*.rs, classify into {wgpu-ready, needs-design, CPU-only-by-nature}, land wgpu-ready ones.~~ (Done — Wave 76 Refinement A above).

### Wave 75 Refinement B — Split scirs2-optimize GPU into single-GPU vs distributed
- gpu_optimize_single_device: unblocked after Wave 75 dispatch substrate; target L-BFGS hot loop
- gpu_optimize_distributed: blocked on MPI/nccl decisions; keep deferred

### Wave 75 Refinement C — Phase-3 remaining integration backlog (scirs2-symbolic)
Three concrete sub-items: (i) extended SR-as-prior for time-series; (ii) ALiBi positional bias for symbolic attention; (iii) Riemann+Weyl tensor in diffgeom (200-400 LoC each).

- [x] Wave 76 Refinement C(iii): scirs2-symbolic diffgeom Riemann tensor (R^μ_{νρσ}, full 4-index, anti-symmetry + Bianchi identity tests) + Weyl tensor (C_{μνρσ}, trace-free, conformally-flat tests) — 10 integration tests (2026-05-25)
- [x] Wave 77 Refinement C(ii): scirs2-symbolic ALiBi symbolic wrapper — alibi_slope, alibi_bias_expr (LoweredOp tree), alibi_bias_matrix_symbolic, verify_symbolic_vs_numerical; 6 tests (2026-05-25)
- [x] Wave 77: scirs2-graph true GPU delta-stepping SSSP — delta_light_kernel + delta_apply_kernel WGSL (light/heavy edge partition, atomicMin f32-bits, adaptive delta heuristic); 2 additional smoke tests (2026-05-25)
- [x] Wave 77: scirs2-optimize CG + Newton GPU — cg_gpu.rs (dot/direction-update via GpuNdarray, GPU_CG_THRESHOLD=4096), newton_gpu.rs (Hessian-vector matmul GPU); use_gpu fields in options; 3 smoke tests (2026-05-25)
- [x] Wave 77: GpuNdarray advanced ops — concatenate(axis>0) WGSL (uniform-based stride computation, per-element gather) + sum(axis=Some) rank≥3 WGSL (per-output-element axis reduction); 3 new smoke tests (2026-05-25)
- [ ] **Item 1 cross-compilation matrix** (deferred 2026-07-05): real cross-target codegen for the 9 non-host `TargetPlatform` variants (Linux arm64, Windows, macOS x64/arm64, Android arm64/x64, iOS arm64/x64, WASM) needs per-target toolchains/linkers/sysroots and a self-contained codegen backend that reconstructs every layer type without a `scirs2-neural` runtime dep — a whole subsystem (>5000 LoC). Deferred; host-target lands now.

---

## Notes

- 2026-05-15 (Wave 75 acceptance): scirs2-integrate/src/specialized/finance/pricing/{monte_carlo,finite_difference,fourier}.rs gained +913 LoC (SABR, Hull-White, Bates, LocalVolatility) outside the approved Wave 75 scope. Code is correct, tests pass, clippy clean — accepted and retained. No revert.

- [ ] `scirs2-ndimage`: `backend/mod.rs:27,125`, `gpu_chunked.rs:546` — **DEFERRED (Wave 78)**: native Metal backend conflicts with Pure-Rust policy; wgpu is the Pure-Rust GPU path. Revisit as a wgpu-image-kernels wave.
  - Priority: P3 | Scope: medium | Hint: prefer wgpu dispatch over the `metal` crate

- [x] `scirs2-ndimage`: `advanced_fusion_algorithms/quantum_consciousness.rs:781,785,792` — wired to existing `neural_processing::reorganize_network_structure` + implemented `apply_temporal_causal_inference` (Wave 78); 3 tests + 1170-suite green

- [x] `scirs2-core`: `python/numpy_compat.rs:86` — **DEFERRED (Wave 78)**: true zero-copy PyBuffer/PyCapsule; opportunistic, lower priority. zero-copy view already implemented via `numpy_readonly_to_scirs_view`; doc updated 2026-06-22
  - Priority: P3 | Scope: medium | Hint: pyo3 buffer protocol / PyBuffer; scirs2-numpy zero-copy path

- [ ] `scirs2-io`: `hdf5/mod.rs:20,40`, `scirs2-datasets/src/hdf5_dataset.rs:28` — **DEFERRED (Wave 78)**: blocked on oxih5 **write** support (read-only at M1).
  - Priority: P2 | Scope: large | Hint: oxih5-core read at M1; write path upstream-blocked

- [x] `scirs2-io`: `gpu/backend_management.rs:34,106,114,121,128` — real device-capability validation via new `GpuDevice::get_info()` (Wave 78); 6 tests + 1244-suite green

- [ ] `scirs2-sparse`: `gpu/cuda.rs:310` — **DEFERRED (Wave 78)**: CUDA-native SpMV conflicts with Pure-Rust policy; route via a future wgpu SpMV wave (GpuNdarray sparse path).
  - Priority: P2 | Scope: medium | Hint: wgpu SpMV via scirs2-core GpuNdarray, not cuSPARSE FFI

- [x] `scirs2-datasets`: `generators/gpu.rs:256,309,506,683` — real `GpuNdarray` dispatch + `gpu_wgpu` feature (Wave 78); 4 smoke tests, max diff ≤1.3e-7 vs CPU

- [x] `scirs2-text`: `lib.rs:211` — stale TODO corrected; suite already wired via in-module `#[path]` include and passing (Wave 78); 26 pos tests + 1717-suite green

## Policy follow-ups (added 2026-06-13 by /policy-check)

### #1 No-unwrap purge — production code only (tests on infallible paths are policy-allowed)

- [x] **All 22 crates** — Verified 2026-06-22: 0 production `.unwrap()` calls. Prior counts (47, 23, etc.) were raw `grep` artifacts including `#[cfg(test)]` modules (policy-exempt) and doc-comments. v0.4.3 quality gate confirmed unwrap-clean; verified again on 0.5.1 branch.

### #9 Test temp-dir hygiene — use std::env::temp_dir()

All hits classified below. BENIGN = error probe on a deliberately non-existent path (no fs write), doc-comment example, data-under-test string, or production validation logic; ACTIONABLE = test that performs real file I/O at a hardcoded path.

**ACTIONABLE** (tests that actually write/read real files at a hardcoded `/tmp/...` path):

- [x] **scirs2-core**: replace hardcoded `/tmp/` in file-creating example — `scirs2-core/examples/simd_scipy_comparison_benchmark.rs:435` (writes CSV to `/tmp/scirs2_benchmark_results.csv`)
- [x] **scirs2-core**: replace hardcoded `/tmp/` in example — `scirs2-core/examples/memory_metrics_snapshots.rs:116` (constructs `Path::new("/tmp/memory_snapshots")`)
- [x] **scirs2-core**: replace hardcoded `/tmp/` in example — `scirs2-core/examples/performance_dashboards_demo.rs:321` (`NotificationChannel::File("/tmp/dashboard_alerts.log")`)
- [x] **scirs2-io**: replace hardcoded `/tmp/` in example — `scirs2-io/examples/network_cloud_example.rs:83` (`cache_dir: Some("/tmp/scirs2_cache")`)
- [x] **scirs2-transform**: replace hardcoded `/tmp/` in example — `scirs2-transform/examples/transform_large_dataset_processing.rs:46` (creates/reads `/tmp/large_dataset.csv`)

**BENIGN** (error probes — deliberately non-existent paths to test error handling; no file is created):

- `scirs2-signal/src/model_weights.rs:437` — loads a non-existent `/tmp/no_such_file_xyzzy.ox` to assert `is_err()`; no write, BENIGN
- `scirs2-datasets/src/hdf5_dataset.rs:201,215` — `is_valid_hdf5` + `from_file` on non-existent paths; no write, BENIGN
- `scirs2-datasets/src/netcdf_dataset.rs:580` — `from_file` on `/tmp/__scirs2_nonexistent_9999.nc`; no write, BENIGN
- `scirs2-neural/src/training/checkpoint.rs:1335,1341` — `load_checkpoint`/`list_checkpoints` on non-existent paths; no write, BENIGN
- `scirs2-neural/src/training/checkpoint.rs:1655` — error-message string content `"/tmp/missing"` only; BENIGN
- `scirs2-core/src/validation/cross_platform.rs:499` — production logic checking if path starts with `/tmp/` for WASM warning; BENIGN (correct usage)
- `scirs2-core/src/validation/cross_platform.rs:882` — calls `validate_path("/tmp/test.txt")`; just validates a path string, no file I/O, BENIGN
- `scirs2-core/src/profiling/mod.rs:310` — already uses `std::env::temp_dir()` for the path; `/tmp/test_profile.csv` is only the `unwrap_or` fallback string (never written), BENIGN
- All `//!` doc-comment lines (`scirs2-core/src/mmap_utils.rs:25`, `src/memory_efficient/*.rs`, `src/serialization/mod.rs:31,207,264,593,617`, `src/arrow_compat/ipc.rs:153`, `src/memory/async_out_of_core.rs:188,424,676,677`, `scirs2-io/src/jsonl.rs:22,23,133`, `scirs2-io/src/formats/orc_lite.rs:254`, `scirs2-io/src/ndjson_streaming.rs:15,22`, `scirs2-autograd/src/variable.rs:57`, `scirs2-autograd/src/graph_viz.rs:321,349`, `scirs2-neural/src/serialization/model_serializer.rs:65,68`, `scirs2-neural/src/training/checkpoint.rs:29`) — all doc comments / examples-in-docs, BENIGN
- `scirs2-stats/examples/advanced_cross_platform_demo.rs:31` — data-under-test string in a test-paths array (no actual I/O call), BENIGN

## Stubs to implement (added 2026-06-22 by /cooljapan-stub-check)

Captured from `rg 'TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX'` across the SciRS2 workspace (raw ~65 hits; doc-prose, SPDX/license, CHANGELOG, `\uXXXX`/hex placeholders, `// NOTE:`, resolved-notes, and `///`/`//!` doc-examples filtered out; vendored upstream code recorded separately below). The following are the genuinely local, actionable items.

- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-interpolate`: `scirs2-interpolate/src/simd_bspline.rs:251` — `TODO`: Fix SIMD implementation in scirs2-core (weighted_sum falls back to scalar to avoid stack overflow) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** `weighted_sum` uses the real SIMD reduction when available instead of always folding scalar "to avoid stack overflow." The stale TODO comment is removed.
  - **Design:** Replace the body of `weighted_sum` (`simd_bspline.rs:244-257`) with the guarded pattern already used by sibling `squared_distances` in the same file (`:224-242`): `if T::simd_available() { T::simd_weighted_sum(values, weights) } else { <existing scalar fold> }`. `simd_weighted_sum` is already on the `SimdUnifiedOps` trait and dispatches to the correct, bounded `simd_weighted_sum_f32/f64` kernels in scirs2-core. No core change required for this item.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-interpolate/src/simd_bspline.rs`.
  - **Tests:** unit test asserting SIMD and scalar paths agree to ~1e-12 on random vectors (f32 + f64), including odd lengths (remainder handling).
  - **Risk:** Negligible — the same trait call already ships in three other live interpolate modules. If the historical overflow re-appears, see item 3's `#[inline(never)]` mitigation (shared root cause).
- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-interpolate`: `scirs2-interpolate/src/spatial/optimized_search.rs:70` — `TODO`: Fix SIMD implementation in scirs2-core (squared_euclidean_distance falls back to scalar) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** `SimdDistanceOps::squared_euclidean_distance` uses SIMD when available; the already-existing-but-unsurfaced core kernels are exposed on the trait so callers don't hand-compose three temp-allocating ops. Precautionary guard against the original stack-overflow hypothesis, with a stress test proving it holds.
  - **Design:**
    - **Core enhancement:** add `simd_distance_squared_euclidean(a: &ArrayView1<T>, b: &ArrayView1<T>) -> T` to `SimdUnifiedOps` (`scirs2-core/src/simd_ops/functions.rs`), implemented for f32/f64 (`functions_4.rs`/`functions_5.rs`) by delegating to the **already-present** `crate::simd::simd_distance_squared_euclidean_f32/f64` (`simd/distances.rs:287,417`, re-exported at `simd/mod.rs:148-152`, currently never surfaced on the trait). Provide the `#[cfg(not(feature="simd"))]` scalar twin.
    - **Precautionary overflow mitigation:** mark the leaf kernels `simd_distance_squared_euclidean_f32/f64` (and, if cheap, the `weighted`/`dot` leaf kernels) `#[inline(never)]`, so the wide `__m256`/`__m256d` stack frame lives in one shallow leaf call rather than being multiplied through each level of the recursive KdTree/BallTree descent that calls this function. This is the concrete fix for the hypothesized debug-build deep-recursion overflow.
    - **Interpolate site:** replace the scalar fold in `optimized_search.rs:60-78` with `if F::simd_available() { F::simd_distance_squared_euclidean(&ArrayView1::from(a), &ArrayView1::from(b)) } else { <existing scalar fold> }` (slice→view adaptation). Remove the stale TODO comment.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-core/src/simd_ops/functions.rs`, `functions_4.rs`, `functions_5.rs`; `scirs2-core/src/simd/distances.rs` (add `#[inline(never)]`); `scirs2-interpolate/src/spatial/optimized_search.rs`.
  - **Tests:** (a) core unit test: new trait method agrees with scalar to ~1e-12 (f32/f64, odd lengths); (b) interpolate **stress test** that calls `squared_euclidean_distance` inside a deep recursion / large KdTree build+query (e.g. ≥10k points, high depth) to confirm no stack overflow with SIMD enabled — this directly validates the mitigation.
  - **Risk:** Low–medium. If enabling SIMD in the recursive path still overflows despite `#[inline(never)]`, the subagent investigates frame size and, if needed, keeps the scalar fallback for the recursive call site only while still shipping the core trait method — returning `deviated` with the stack evidence rather than silently reverting.
- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-signal`: `scirs2-signal/src/lib.rs:443` — `TODO`: Investigate perfect reconstruction requirements (DWT test only checks non-empty output, not PR) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** `test_dwt_phase3_verification` (`lib.rs:408-445`) asserts genuine perfect reconstruction `waverec(wavedec(x)) ≈ x` within a tight tolerance across real wavelet families, encoding the actual PR requirements (family/mode/level/length) rather than "output is non-empty."
  - **Design:** The `waverec` doctest (`dwt/multiscale.rs:132-135`) already asserts PR to 1e-10 (DB(4), level 2, 8 samples), so a real `#[test]` mirroring it should pass. The subagent must FIRST empirically determine which `(Wavelet, mode, level, length)` combos give exact PR (orthogonal families Haar/DB/Sym/Coif; try `mode = Some("periodic")` on 2^k-length signals, per exploration boundary analysis), then write assertions over exactly those, tol ~1e-10, plus assert filter validity via `crate::dwt::utils::check_perfect_reconstruction(&wavelet.filters()?, Some(1e-10))`. Document the confirmed PR requirement in a short test comment. If a family/mode that *should* be PR is not (e.g. boundary heuristics in `boundary.rs`/`waverec` length reconciliation break it), fix the reconstruction path — that is the real work of "investigate PR requirements," not weakening the assertion.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-signal/src/lib.rs` (the test); possibly `dwt/multiscale.rs` / `dwt/boundary.rs` / `dwt/transform.rs` only if a genuine reconstruction fix is needed.
  - **Tests:** the rewritten `test_dwt_phase3_verification` IS the test; add parametrized coverage over ≥3 orthogonal families and ≥2 levels. Must pass (Phase 3 gate).
  - **Risk:** Medium — a strict PR assertion may expose real boundary/length behavior. The subagent lands on a passing real test either by relying on the genuinely-PR config (likely DB(4) level-matched, per the passing doctest) or by fixing reconstruction; it must not fall back to a non-empty check. If PR is fundamentally unsupported for all configs (unexpected), return `deviated` with evidence.
- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-stats`: `scirs2-stats/src/scipy_benchmark_framework.rs:360` — `TODO`: Implement memory tracking (`peak_memory: 0`, `average_memory: 0`) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** `MemoryComparison { peak_memory, average_memory }` in `compare_performance` (`scipy_benchmark_framework.rs:325-365`) carries real resident-memory figures sampled around the benchmarked closure, via a Pure-Rust facility.
  - **Design:** Mirror the existing timing loop in `measure_timing` (`:368-388`). Sample resident memory before/after each timed iteration using scirs2-core's Pure-Rust RSS profiler `scirs2_core::profiling::memory_profiling::MemoryStats::current()` (mach `task_info` on macOS, `/proc/self/statm` on Linux — no jemalloc). `peak_memory = max(after − before)`, `average_memory = mean(samples)`; set `efficiency_ratio` when a baseline is available. Enable the core feature: add `memory_tracking = ["scirs2-core/profiling_memory"]` to `scirs2-stats/Cargo.toml` and gate the sampling on it (default build keeps clean, honest fallback to 0 with a comment when the feature/platform is unavailable). `profiling_memory` pulls `libc` for syscalls only — acceptable Pure-Rust (feature-gated, no banned C library). Alternative if the core feature is awkward: `scirs2_core::bench_utils::memory_bench` (needs `cross_platform`).
  - **Files:** `scirs2-stats/src/scipy_benchmark_framework.rs`, `scirs2-stats/Cargo.toml` (workspace-style optional feature).
  - **Tests:** a benchmark over a deliberately-allocating closure (e.g. builds a large `Vec`/`Array`) asserts `peak_memory > 0` and `average_memory > 0` when the feature is enabled; a no-alloc closure keeps them small. Use `std::env::temp_dir()` if any file I/O.
  - **Risk:** Low–medium — RSS deltas are approximate (OS lazy reclaim). Document the approximation; assert `> 0` / ordering rather than exact bytes to avoid flakiness.
- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-io`: `scirs2-io/src/gpu/compression.rs:301` — `TODO`: Add compute units when available in PlatformCapabilities (writes a hardcoded `32u32` placeholder into the OpenCL header) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** The OpenCL compression header carries the real compute-unit count.
  - **Design:** In `compress_opencl` (`gpu/compression.rs:296-303`) replace the hardcoded `32u32` with the real value, mirroring `get_performance_stats` (same file, `:525-548`): `let compute_units = self.gpu_processor.get_backend_capabilities().map(|c| c.compute_units as u32).unwrap_or(32); result.extend_from_slice(&compute_units.to_le_bytes());`. `BackendCapabilities.compute_units` already exists (`gpu/backend_management.rs:395`). Do NOT touch `scirs2_core::simd_ops::PlatformCapabilities` — it is API-frozen and lacks a CU field; the io-local `BackendCapabilities` is the right source. Remove the stale TODO comment.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-io/src/gpu/compression.rs`.
  - **Tests:** a unit test that decodes the OpenCL header bytes and asserts the compute-units field equals the value returned by `get_backend_capabilities()` (or the `32` CPU fallback when unavailable) — not a hardcoded literal.
  - **Risk:** Low — no core/API-frozen change; pattern already proven in the same file.
- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-core`: `scirs2-core/src/python/numpy_compat.rs:86` — `TODO`: Investigate true zero-copy with lifetimes (currently always `to_owned()`) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** Confirm the "true zero-copy with lifetimes" question is genuinely resolved and leave the code + comment honest.
  - **Design:** `numpy_to_scirs_arrayd` (`python/numpy_compat.rs:77`) returns an **owned** `ArrayD<T>`, which by its return type cannot be zero-copy; the real zero-copy path already exists as `numpy_readonly_to_scirs_view` (`:172-176`, tested by `test_zero_copy_view` at `:240`). No behavioral change needed. Action: ensure the explanatory comment at `:85-88` correctly points callers to `numpy_readonly_to_scirs_view` and states the concrete lifetime obstacle (the `.readonly()` guard is a local; a returned borrowing view would dangle — the caller must own the guard). Remove any residual stale "TODO: Investigate…" wording.
  - **Files:** `scirs2-core/src/python/numpy_compat.rs` (comment only, if anything).
  - **Tests:** confirm `test_zero_copy_view` exists and passes (feature `python`); no new test unless the comment edit warrants none.
  - **Risk:** Negligible. This is a verify-and-document closure, not a code change. If the `python` feature isn't part of the default build, the subagent verifies under the feature.
- [x] **scirs2** `scirs2-core`: `scirs2-core/src/random/neural_sampling.rs:154` — `TODO`: use `_total_loss` (negative log-likelihood) for monitoring (computed then discarded) (planned 2026-07-05)
  - **Goal:** `NormalizingFlow::train` (and its 3 siblings) no longer discard the per-epoch negative-log-likelihood; it is accumulated into a `training_history: Vec<f64>`, surfaced in the epoch log and via a getter.
  - **Design:** In `random/neural_sampling.rs`: rename `_total_loss` → `total_loss` (`:145,154`); add `training_history: Vec<f64>` to `NormalizingFlow` (`:64`), init empty in `new` (`:90`) and in the struct literal (`:120`); push per-epoch average loss inside the epoch loop; include it in the epoch `println!` (`:162`, e.g. `"Epoch {epoch}: loss = {avg:.6}"`); add `pub fn training_history(&self) -> &[f64]`. Per IMPLEMENT POLICY + consistency, extend the identical pattern to the other three discard sites: `ScoreBasedDiffusion::train` (`:468`), `EnergyBasedModel::train` (`:718`), `NeuralPosteriorEstimation::train` (`:858`) — each gets a `training_history` field + getter + real loss logging. Keep every signature `Result<(), String>` (don't break the API).
  - **Files:** `scirs2-core/src/random/neural_sampling.rs`.
  - **Tests:** train each model a few epochs on tiny synthetic data; assert `training_history()` is non-empty, length matches epochs (or the logging cadence), and all entries are finite.
  - **Risk:** Low — additive fields on `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` structs; no API break.
