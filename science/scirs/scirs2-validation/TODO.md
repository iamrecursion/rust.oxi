# scirs2-validation TODO

## Status: v0.6.3 (2026-07-27)

No scirs2-validation-specific changes shipped in 0.6.3; all content below (verified as of 2026-07-22) remains accurate.

## Purpose

Shared statistical validation framework providing pre-computed analytical reference values, generic validation traits, property-test helpers, and report generation. Designed to be consumed by any COOLJAPAN ecosystem crate without introducing circular dependencies.

## Completed

### Reference Distributions (15+)
- [x] Normal (0,1) and (2,3)
- [x] Exponential (rate=1)
- [x] Uniform (0,1)
- [x] Beta (2,5)
- [x] Gamma (2,1)
- [x] Chi-squared (df=4)
- [x] Student's t (df=5)
- [x] Cauchy (0,1)
- [x] Poisson (lambda=3)
- [x] Binomial (10, 0.3)
- [x] Weibull (k=2, scale=1)
- [x] Log-normal (0,1)
- [x] Laplace (0,1)
- [x] Pareto (alpha=1, scale=2)

### Validation Functions
- [x] `validate_distribution` — PDF/CDF/PPF/moment comparison vs `DistributionReference`
- [x] `validate_pdf_integral` — trapezoidal rule integration check
- [x] `validate_cdf_monotone` — non-decreasing CDF verification
- [x] `validate_ppf_roundtrip` — `cdf(ppf(p)) ≈ p` check
- [x] `validate_cdf_bounds` — tail behaviour verification
- [x] `validate_pdf_nonnegative` — non-negativity check

### Reporting
- [x] ASCII tabular report via `generate_report`
- [x] JSON report via `generate_json_report` (no serde required for default)
- [x] `ValidationReport` aggregator with pass/fail summary
- [x] Optional `serialization` feature for richer serde-based output

## v0.6.1 Quality Gate (verified 2026-07-15)

- 25 `#[test]` functions (all passing) + 1 passing doctest, covering the full distribution validation suite
- `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()` count: 0
- cargo check + clippy: clean
- Pure Rust (no C/Fortran deps); core has zero non-stdlib runtime dependencies (serde optional)

## Notes

- Crate is `publish = false` — designed for internal use by the SciRS2 ecosystem.
- All reference values are derived analytically and verifiable by hand (no external numerical tools).
- Wave 8 distribution accuracy fixes (Beta CDF Lentz fraction, F-dist via regularized beta, ChiSquare even-df Poisson sum, Normal PPF Acklam, Pareto PDF strict boundary) were validated through this framework during their development.
- **Known gap**: despite being designed as the shared reference-value source for `scirs2-stats`, `scirs2-stability-tests`, and sibling ecosystem crates, as of v0.6.3 no other workspace crate (and no other `~/work/*` COOLJAPAN project) actually depends on `scirs2-validation` — a workspace-wide search (re-verified 2026-07-22) still finds zero `scirs2-validation` Cargo dependencies and zero `scirs2_validation::` imports outside this crate itself. The earlier claim in this file that the suite was "consumed by `scirs2-stability-tests` and downstream crates" was not accurate and has been removed. Wiring this framework into an actual consumer (most naturally `scirs2-stats`'s own test suite) remains open future work.
