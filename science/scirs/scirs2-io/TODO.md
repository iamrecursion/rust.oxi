# scirs2-io TODO

## Status: v0.6.5 (2026-07-31)

**NetCDF3 Classic backend is now real.** `netcdf/classic_backend.rs` (490 lines, new) adapts
`NetCDFFile` onto the pure-Rust `netcdf3` crate (`netcdf3 = { workspace = true }` in `Cargo.toml`
— previously listed as unused dead weight; see the corrected Known Issues entry below) for
genuine CDF-1/CDF-2 binary read/write, including a documented workaround for a `netcdf3` 0.6.1
`FileWriter::close()` defect (verified via standalone reproduction against the `netcdf3` crate
directly: `close()` fills any variable that was never explicitly written using the
*dataset-wide* record count/stride rather than that variable's own — correct for record
variables, but wrong for a fixed-size variable sharing a dataset with record variables that have
`numrecs > 1`, which silently corrupted already-written sibling data). This module now always
writes every fixed-size variable explicitly instead of relying on `close()`'s auto-fill. The
previous no-op stand-in is preserved for reference under `netcdf/backup/`. NetCDF4 (HDF5-based)
is unaffected — it already used the separate, real `oxih5`-backed `crate::hdf5` path.

Dependency bumps this cycle: `oxicode` 0.2.4 → 0.2.5, `oxiz` 0.3.0 → 0.3.1,
`oxiarc-archive`/`-lz4`/`-bzip2`/`-zstd`/`-deflate`/`-snappy`/`-brotli` 0.3.6 → 0.4.0. This crate
has zero `#[ignore]`d tests both before and after the workspace-wide ignore-legitimacy audit
(132 → 59 ignores workspace-wide) — unaffected by that pass.

## Status: v0.6.3 (2026-07-27)

Untouched by this release (no io-specific changes shipped in 0.6.3); the 0.6.2 changes and test
counts below remain accurate since the crate source is unchanged.

**0.6.2:** MAT v7.3 (HDF5-based) support — `EnhancedMatFile`, `V73MatFile`, `PartialIoSupport` — is now available in default builds; all 45 feature gates across `matlab::enhanced`/`matlab::v73_enhanced` that previously required the `hdf5` Cargo feature (and a system `libhdf5`) are gone now that the backend is pure-Rust `oxih5`. The in-tree `hdf5_lite` module (2697 lines) was deleted outright; `oxih5` now serves every HDF5 path in the crate, widening format coverage (superblock v2/v3, fractal heaps, extensible arrays, virtual datasets, szip) beyond what `hdf5_lite` supported. Fixed three real bugs: `create_dataset_with_compression` was silently dropping every value it was handed (critical silent-data-loss bug), writing a `SparseLogical` matrix to MAT v7.3 stored all zeros, and the HDF5 v2-dataspace header was mis-parsed as three bytes instead of four. Added a new `tests/hdf5_conformance.rs` integration suite. See `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.6.2]` for full detail.

Zero `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()` stubs in `src/`. Freshly measured test counts (2026-07-15, predates the 0.6.2 changes above): `cargo nextest run -p scirs2-io` → 1294 tests run, 1294 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed; `--all-features` → 1405 tests run, 1405 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed. The OpenCL GPU-compression header now reports the adapter's real compute-unit count instead of a hardcoded placeholder (`gpu/compression.rs:305-310`, covered by `test_compress_opencl_header_uses_real_compute_units`). `src/hdf5/` and `src/advanced_coordinator/` were split into per-file module directories (all files under 2000 lines) via SplitRS, re-exports preserved. `zarr` v2/v3 confirmed publicly exported and non-stub. This pass re-verified every "v0.4.0 Roadmap" item below against `src/`: all are real, but several are scoped more narrowly than their one-line description implies (in-memory-only Kafka/Arrow Flight/MQTT-broker protocol simulations with no live network I/O; "-inspired" TileDB/Lance formats and a "simplified" Iceberg that are not byte-compatible with the reference ecosystem tools; cloud S3/GCS/Azure backends that build real config/state-machine/URL-signing logic but never make a live HTTP call, even with their feature flags enabled). Given the breadth of explicit off-by-default stub features (`postgres`/`mysql`/`mongodb`/`redis`, live cloud HTTP, Azure SAS signing), the status badge is **Partial** rather than Stable, even though the always-on default surface is solid and 100% green. See `README.md` for the precise, per-feature caveats.

- [x] TileDB integration: dense and sparse multi-dimensional arrays for analytics — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`tiledb/` module, own doc comment says "TileDB-inspired"); pure-Rust array storage inspired by TileDB's design, not a client for real TileDB arrays
- [x] Lance format: modern columnar format for ML datasets — Implemented in v0.4.0 (`lance/` module, own doc comment says "Lance-inspired ... pure Rust, in-process"); not binary-compatible with the reference Lance format

## Known Issues

- **[Corrected 2026-07-31]** ~~NetCDF: Hand-rolled, pure-Rust NetCDF3 Classic and NetCDF4/HDF5 reader/writer with unlimited dimensions and chunking (`netcdf/`, 1300+ lines; does not wrap the external `netcdf3` crate — that dependency is currently unused dead weight in `Cargo.toml`)~~ Obsolete as of 0.6.5: `netcdf/classic_backend.rs` (490 lines, new) now adapts `NetCDFFile` onto the real `netcdf3` crate for genuine CDF-1/CDF-2 binary read/write (previously a no-op stand-in, now kept for reference under `netcdf/backup/`), including a documented workaround for a `netcdf3` 0.6.1 `FileWriter::close()` defect that could silently corrupt fixed-size-variable data in a dataset that also contains record variables. `netcdf3` is no longer unused/dead weight in `Cargo.toml`. NetCDF4 (HDF5-based) was and remains real via the separate `oxih5`-backed `crate::hdf5` path.
- **[Corrected 2026-07-22]** ~~Large HDF5 files with deeply nested groups may be slow on the pure-Rust hdf5-lite reader; the system-library `hdf5` feature should be preferred for those workloads.~~ Obsolete as of 0.6.2: the `hdf5_lite` module was deleted outright (2697 lines), superseded by the pure-Rust `oxih5` backend for every HDF5 path in the crate; the `hdf5` Cargo feature is now a no-op alias (HDF5 support is unconditional), not a system-library switch — there is no `libhdf5` alternative to fall back to any more. Performance of `oxih5` on deeply-nested-group files has not been independently benchmarked.
- **[Corrected 2026-07-15]** ~~The ORC reader does not yet support all column encodings (RLE v2, dictionary, DIRECT_V2); unsupported columns fall back to raw bytes.~~ Verified stale: both `formats::orc` and `formats::orc_lite` implement RLE v2 integer encoding (direct/delta/variable-length modes), dictionary string encoding, and bit-packed boolean RLE (`orc.rs::decode_i64`/`decode_dict_strings`/`decode_bool_rle`, `orc_lite.rs::IntRleV2`). Remaining caveat: neither format reads/writes third-party `.orc` files produced by Hive/Spark/etc. — both use their own magic bytes and framing (`ORCEXT\0\0` / `ORCLITE\0`) rather than the real Apache ORC Protobuf postscript/footer, so they are ORC-inspired pure-Rust formats, not Apache-ORC-file-compatible readers.
- **[Corrected 2026-07-15]** ~~Arrow IPC streaming does not yet validate all IPC message types; unknown message types are silently skipped.~~ Verified stale: `arrow_ipc::read_message`/`read_batches` and `arrow_streaming::read_message` now return `IoError::FormatError` ("Unexpected/unexpected message type ...") on any unrecognized message tag instead of skipping it silently.
- **[Refined 2026-07-15]** Cloud connector framework (`cloud`, `network::cloud`, `s3_multipart`) provides the interface, config/URL-signing types, and simulated multipart/resumable-upload state machines only. Verified: even with `aws-sdk-s3` / `google-cloud-storage` / `azure-storage-blobs` enabled, `ObjectStore::put/get/delete/list/head` on the S3/GCS/Azure backends unconditionally return a "real HTTP implementation not yet complete" error (`cloud/mod.rs`) — no live network call is made under any current feature combination, so simply "activating `reqwest`" is not sufficient to get real cloud I/O. Separately, Azure SAS token generation (`cloud/azure_sas.rs`) signs with a deterministic placeholder (`mock_sign`, explicitly documented as "NOT cryptographically secure"), not HMAC-SHA256 — do not use for production Azure authentication.
- BSON serialization of f32 arrays upcasts to f64 to conform with the BSON type system (confirmed: `BsonValue` has no dedicated `Float32` variant, only `Double(f64)`).
