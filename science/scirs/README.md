**What's New in 0.6.5** — Ignore-Audit Bug Hunt: the Live Backward Pass Was Mostly Dead Code:

- **scirs2-autograd**: the single most impactful fix in this release. The live backward-pass dispatcher (a ~670-line if/else chain keyed on op-name strings) covered only 58 of 281 differentiable op implementations; every op it didn't recognize silently fell through to an identity gradient, with no error or warning. Dispatch now consults each op's own `Op::grad()` implementation first, converting roughly 223 wrong-or-absent gradients to correct ones — including every elementary math function (`sqrt`/`exp`/`ln`/trig/hyperbolic-trig/`log2`/`log10`/`abs`) and activation (`softplus`/`elu`/`swish`/`gelu`/`mish`). Also fixed: `reduce_sum`/`transpose`/`gather` were only correct under an all-ones cotangent, `reduce_mean` lost its `1/N` factor, `sigmoid_cross_entropy` and `BatchMatMul` were misidentified by fragile substring matching, `concat`/`einsum`/`tensordot` panicked during backprop, and `SymmetricEigenOp` now genuinely diagonalizes via cyclic Jacobi instead of separate per-size special cases. The public custom-gradient API (`custom_op`, `scale_gradient`, `selective_stop_gradient`, `detach`) was a complete no-op regardless of the user's backward closure — now genuinely functional.
- **scirs2-linalg**: a real, convergence-checked general (non-symmetric) eigenvalue/Schur engine (Householder→Hessenberg reduction, then implicit double-shift Francis QR with deflation) now backs `decomposition::schur`, `lapack::eig`, and `eigen::advanced_precision_eig`, replacing per-call implementations that either never checked for convergence or only worked on already-diagonal input.
- **scirs2-stats**: fixed an asymmetric/backwards one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value (printing logically-inverted "Rejected"/"Not rejected" conclusions), a hardcoded-zero F-test p-value in `polyfit`, a self-deadlocking `ErrorMonitor`, and garbage-output Niederreiter/Sobol QMC sequence generators.
- **scirs2-graph**: spectral clustering and Hungarian matching now compute real linear-algebra/optimal-assignment answers instead of a random/stand-in result; `watts_strogatz_graph` no longer hangs on ~99.8% of seeds at `p > 0` (its rewiring step checked `has_node`, always `true`, instead of `has_edge`).
- **scirs2-io / scirs2-integrate / scirs2-series / scirs2-spatial / scirs2-ndimage / scirs2-special**: real NetCDF3 read/write (was a no-op stand-in), real DOP853/RK23 adaptive-step error estimators, a fixed `out_of_core` streaming hang/unbounded-memory-growth/double-count, fixed inverted `octree`/`quadtree` k-NN `BinaryHeap` ordering (was returning the *farthest* candidates) and an always-zero A* path cost, a mmap loader that ignored its own file header (shifting every element), and `gamma(x)` silently returning `inf` for `x` in ~[140.5, 171].
- **scirs2-signal**: wired 83 previously-orphaned-but-real files back into the crate — a full Kalman filter family (standard/extended/unscented/ensemble/information/particle), a BSS/ICA toolkit, compressed-sensing sparse recovery (OMP/basis-pursuit/LASSO/CoSaMP), and a SciPy-`ShortTimeFFT`-class STFT port — and deleted ~167 unreachable legacy/duplicate files (541 total `.rs` files, 255 unreachable — 47% of the crate).
- **Workspace-wide**: completed a full `#[ignore]`-legitimacy audit — every ignored test workspace-wide actually run and root-caused, not just read — dropping the count from 132 (~31% bare/no-reason) to 59, every one now reason-tagged (`requires-gpu:`/`requires-env:`/`slow:`/`bench:`/`not-implemented:`) and enforced going forward by a new `cargo-scirs2-policy` lint.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[0.6.5]` for the complete list.

**What's New in 0.6.4** — wasm32 Follow-Up Fix:

- **oxifft wasm32 threading fix**: `oxifft` 0.4.1 added a hard `compile_error!` when its `threading` (rayon) feature is active on `wasm32` targets. `scirs2-fft` and `scirs2-signal` now declare `oxifft` via target-gated `[target.'cfg(...)'.dependencies]` tables — full defaults off-wasm, `default-features = false, features = ["std"]` on `wasm32` — resolving the error.
- **scirs2-wasm and scirs2 (meta-crate) resume publishing**: both were skipped from 0.6.3 because the fix above landed too late to affect the `scirs2-fft`/`scirs2-signal` artifacts crates.io already had at that version. They catch up at 0.6.4.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[0.6.4]` for the complete list.

**What's New in 0.6.3** — Windows-Compatibility Hardening:

- **Heap corruption fixed**: `scirs2-spatial`'s `DistancePool` allocated cache-aligned buffers via a raw `System.alloc` call, then freed them through `Box<[f64]>`'s default-aligned `Drop` — an alloc/dealloc layout mismatch that is undefined behavior. glibc's allocator tolerated it; Windows' does not, corrupting the heap (`STATUS_HEAP_CORRUPTION`). Now allocates through plain `Vec`/`Box<[f64]>`. `scirs2-stats`'s `AdaptiveMemoryManager` had a related bug: it re-derived the deallocation strategy from config instead of the strategy `allocate` actually resolved for that pointer, so `Adaptive`-configured pools could be freed through the wrong allocator; `allocate` now records the resolved strategy per pointer for `deallocate` to look up.
- **Stack overflow fixed**: `scirs2-symbolic`'s `EmlNode` gained an explicit iterative `Drop` impl — the compiler-derived recursive one overflowed the stack when a deep expression tree (e.g. a 10,000-node chain) went out of scope, fitting in Linux's 8 MB default thread stack but not Windows' 1 MB default (`STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW`).
- **Process abort fixed**: `scirs2-transform`'s `AdvancedMemoryPool::prewarm_common_sizes` eagerly pre-allocated up to ~5.5 GB of spare buffers just to construct an `AdvancedPCA`; Linux's overcommit hid the cost, Windows backed the whole reservation up front and aborted. Pre-warming is now capped by a 64 MB budget.
- **Path validation fixed**: `scirs2-core`'s `CrossPlatformValidator::validate_windows_path` flagged the drive-letter colon in any absolute Windows path (e.g. `C:\Users\...`) as an invalid character, rejecting every such path.
- **Numerical correctness**: `scirs2-signal`'s Francis double-shift QR (ESPRIT phase estimation) had two bugs letting eigenvalues silently drift from the input matrix's; `n4sid_estimate`'s least-squares solve used normal equations, which silently returned bogus huge-norm solutions for rank-deficient (non-persistently-exciting) inputs instead of erroring — both now go through an SVD-based minimum-norm solve.
- **Dependency bumps**: `oxifft` 0.3.2→0.4.1, `oxicuda-*` 0.5.1→0.5.3, `oxiz` 0.2.4→0.3.0.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[0.6.3]` for the complete list.

**What's New in 0.6.2** — Pure Rust Hardening: HDF5, Tracy, NUMA & OpenCL:

- **Real pure-Rust HDF5 backend**: MAT v7.3 (HDF5-based) support is now available in **default builds** — `EnhancedMatFile`/`V73MatFile` no longer require a system `libhdf5`. The in-tree `hdf5_lite` reader (2,697 lines) is retired in favor of `oxih5`, which widens format coverage (superblock v2/v3, fractal heaps, extensible arrays, virtual datasets, szip) and fixes a critical silent-data-loss bug where compressed-dataset writes were silently dropped, plus a mis-parsed version-2 dataspace header that had been self-concealed by a buggy test fixture.
- **C/C++ dependencies removed**: `hdf5` (C-linked), `libnuma`, `tracy-client` (C++) and `opencl3` are all gone from the dependency graph. `scirs2-core`'s Tracy profiling is now a pure-Rust Chrome-Trace-Event exporter; NUMA topology discovery reads real `/sys` data instead of estimating "8 cores per node"; OpenCL support now runtime-`dlopen`s the system ICD instead of linking at build time. `scirs2-spatial`'s `NumaTopology::detect()` had the same fabricated-data problem (hardcoded core/memory estimates) — it now reads the real Linux `sysfs` topology, with an honest single-node fallback elsewhere.
- **BREAKING (TLS)**: `reqwest`/`ureq` now build with `rustls-no-provider`, dropping the C `aws-lc-rs`/`ring` backends; SciRS2 auto-installs a pure-Rust `oxitls-rustcrypto-provider` on first use unless the application already installed its own `CryptoProvider`.
- **scirs2-ndimage**: CUDA kernel JIT now compiles through the pure-Rust `oxicuda-nvrtc` crate (runtime `dlopen`, zero build-time CUDA SDK dependency).
- **Dependency bumps**: `oxih5`/`oxih5-core` 0.1.3→0.2.2, `oxisql-*` 0.3.2→0.4.0, `oxiz` 0.2.3→0.2.4, `oxicuda-*` 0.5.0→0.5.1 (+new `oxicuda-nvrtc`), Cranelift 0.133→0.134 (fixes a `memmap2` unsound advisory, RUSTSEC-2026-0186).

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[0.6.2]` for the complete list.

**What's New in 0.6.1** — Real Codegen, DLPack Safety & GPU-Dispatch Honesty:

- **Real model-serving codegen**: `scirs2-neural`'s `ModelPackager::package()` now genuinely compiles a Rust project via `cargo`/`rustc` for native binaries (`PackageFormat::Native`) and C-shared-library (`PackageFormat::CSharedLibrary`) targets, replacing the previous placeholder byte-writing stubs; new `serving` module split into `mod.rs`/`types.rs`/`packager.rs`/`codegen.rs`/`tests.rs`.
- **Critical DLPack fix**: a missing `#[repr(C)]` on `to_dlpack`'s `BackingStore` in `scirs2-python` caused a process-crashing SIGBUS whenever the DLPack capsule was garbage-collected; also fixed a double-consumption bug in the capsule destructor and a stride-handling bug in `from_dlpack` that silently produced wrong data for non-contiguous/transposed tensors.
- **GPU-dispatch and hardware-detection honesty**: `scirs2-datasets`'s `AdvancedGpuOptimizer` now performs real wgpu/`GpuNdarray` GPU dispatch instead of a simulated mock (minor breaking change: `BenchmarkResult.gpu_time_ms`/`.speedup` are now `Option<f64>`, `None` when no real GPU dispatch ran); `scirs2-core`'s `PlatformCapabilities::detect()` now runtime-probes for real NVIDIA/Metal GPU hardware instead of hardcoding `cuda_available` to `false`; `scirs2-special`'s permanently-failing `execute_kernel` GPU path now has a real CPU fallback for `gamma`/`bessel_j0`/`erf`; wgpu adapter/device discovery across 7 crates now restricts to `Backends::PRIMARY` (Vulkan/Metal/DX12/BrowserWebGPU) instead of `Backends::all()`, so a broken secondary GL backend can no longer report false availability and then die on first use.
- **New API surface**: `F` distribution `ppf()` (inverse CDF) in `scirs2-stats`, plus opt-in real memory tracking in its SciPy benchmark framework; `hamming()` distance in `scirs2-spatial`; finance facades (`AdvancedMonteCarloEngine`, `RealTimeRiskMonitor`, `ExoticOptionPricer`, `RiskAnalyzer`) in `scirs2-integrate`; `training_history()` on `scirs2-core`'s generative-sampling models (`NormalizingFlow` and others) and `export_data()` on `ProductionProfiler`; `simd_distance_squared_euclidean` on `SimdUnifiedOps`.
- **Correctness fixes**: `scirs2-autograd`'s gradient-dispatch engine now actually invokes `CondOp`/`LogDetOp` backward rules (previously dead code behind op-name string dispatch), plus a proper Wielandt-deflation SVD fix and a condition-number computation fix; `scirs2-signal`'s `waverec` now reconstructs to the correct original length (was `2x` for non-Haar filters) with real perfect-reconstruction verification; restored SIMD paths for `scirs2-interpolate`'s `weighted_sum`/`squared_euclidean_distance` (previously always fell back to scalar); fixed a GEMM operand-layout bug in the `scirs2-datasets`/`scirs2-interpolate`/`scirs2-optimize` CUDA paths (mistagged `ColMajor`, but `oxicuda-blas` requires `RowMajor`); two Miri-detected undefined-behavior fixes (unaligned-reference UB in `cast_bytes_to_slice`, a missing-`else` branch in a SIMD kernel).
- **Housekeeping**: removed 14 dead/orphaned stub types from `scirs2-stats`; split 3 oversized (>2000-line) files into module directories via SplitRS (`scirs2-io`'s `advanced_coordinator.rs`/`hdf5/mod.rs`, `scirs2-series`'s `utils.rs`); dependency bumps — `oxiarc-archive`/`-lz4`/`-bzip2`/`-zstd`/`-deflate`/`-snappy`/`-brotli` `0.3.3` → `0.3.6` (the `0.3.4` regression this was previously pinned around is fixed upstream as of `0.3.5`), `oxisql-core`/`-sqlite-compat` `0.3.1` → `0.3.2`, `oxicuda-*` `0.4.0` → `0.5.0`; `cargo-scirs2-policy`'s `--format` flag is now a validated enum instead of silently falling back on typos.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[0.6.1]` for the complete list.

**What's New in 0.6.0** — Pure-Rust CUDA Decentralization:

- **`oxicuda-*` CUDA backends**: introduced a direct, per-crate, off-by-default, runtime-probed `cuda` feature across 10 crates — scirs2-fft, scirs2-symbolic, scirs2-interpolate, scirs2-special, scirs2-stats, scirs2-graph, scirs2-linalg, scirs2-optimize, scirs2-datasets, scirs2-vision — decentralizing GPU acceleration out of `scirs2-core`. Every path is f64-native, real CUDA PTX→driver JIT (not a CPU/wgpu simulation), and additive alongside the existing wgpu portability story.
- **wgpu feature standardization** (breaking): every real wgpu/WebGPU portability feature across the ecosystem renamed to a single `wgpu` name (was `wgpu_backend`/`gpu_wgpu`/`wgpu_fft`/`wgpu_kernels`/`wgpu_rbf`).
- **Pure Rust win**: retired `scirs2-core`'s cudarc-based CUDA backend entirely, dropping the `cudarc` dependency; `GpuBackend::Cuda` now directs users to the per-crate `oxicuda-*` features.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) `[0.6.0]` for the complete list.

**What's New in 0.5.1** — Correctness, API-Stability & Pure Rust Hardening:

- **Exact autograd gradients**: new `TraceBackwardOp` (reverse-mode gradient for `trace`) and a `tensor_ops/decomposition_backward.rs` module with exact spectral gradients — matrix-sqrt (Sylvester equation), matrix-log/matrix-power (Daleckii–Krein divided differences), and reduced-SVD VJP (degenerate-singular-value detection). Previously these returned all-zeros or wrong shapes.
- **API stability**: restored the `#[non_exhaustive]` attribute on `scirs2-core`'s `CoreError` (lost previously); a new `core_error_non_exhaustive` compile-fail test in `scirs2-stability-tests` now guards the contract.
- **GPU/CUDA honesty**: CUDA/GPU paths across scirs2-core, scirs2-linalg, and scirs2-fft now report `BackendNotAvailable` / `NotImplemented` / `Option<f64>` metrics when no real device or measurement exists, instead of returning fabricated contexts or invented throughput numbers.
- **Zarr v2/v3**: chunked-array support is now publicly exported (`pub mod zarr`) — directory stores, codec pipeline, and chunk-boundary slice I/O.
- **Pure Rust hardening**: removed the C/MPFR `rug`, C-backed `rusqlite`, `tokenizers`, and external `either`/`hex`/`urlencoding`/`data-encoding` crates — arbitrary precision now on `oxinum-*`, SQLite on `oxisql-sqlite-compat`, `blake3` built with its no-ASM `pure` feature. Ecosystem dep bumps: OxiArc 0.3.3, OxiSQL 0.3.1, OxiNum 0.1.2, OxiH5 0.1.3, OxiZ 0.2.3, OxiCode 0.2.4, plus OxiEML 0.1.2.
- **Numerical bug fixes**: scirs2-series ADF test now uses an SVD-based Moore–Penrose pseudo-inverse for rank-deficient designs; plus 5 newly-fixed numerical bugs — SSPRK(5,4) integrator (now true 4th-order), Haar perfect-reconstruction check, cheby2/bessel bandpass transfer functions, and TimeSeriesReservoir exponential recency weighting.

- **No Circular Dependencies**: Clear hierarchy prevents circular dependencies
- **AI/ML Focus**: Specialized modules for machine learning and AI workloads
- **Feature Flags**: Granular control over enabled functionality
- **Memory Efficiency**: Import only what you need to reduce overhead

## Advanced Core Features

The core module (scirs2-core) provides several advanced features that are leveraged across the ecosystem:

### GPU Acceleration

```rust
use scirs2_core::gpu::{GpuContext, GpuBackend, GpuBuffer};

// Create a GPU context with the default backend
let ctx = GpuContext::new(GpuBackend::default())?;

// Allocate memory on the GPU
let mut buffer = ctx.create_buffer::<f32>(1024);

// Execute a computation
ctx.execute(|compiler| {
    let kernel = compiler.compile(kernel_code)?;
    kernel.set_buffer(0, &mut buffer);
    kernel.dispatch([1024, 1, 1]);
    Ok(())
})?;
```

### Memory Management

```rust
use scirs2_core::memory::{ChunkProcessor2D, BufferPool, ZeroCopyView};

// Process large arrays in chunks
let mut processor = ChunkProcessor2D::new(&large_array, (1000, 1000));
processor.process_chunks(|chunk, coords| {
    // Process each chunk...
});

// Reuse memory with buffer pools
let mut pool = BufferPool::<f64>::new();
let mut buffer = pool.acquire_vec(1000);
// Use buffer...
pool.release_vec(buffer);
```

### Memory Metrics and Profiling

```rust
use scirs2_core::memory::metrics::{track_allocation, generate_memory_report};
use scirs2_core::profiling::{Profiler, Timer};

// Track memory allocations
track_allocation("MyComponent", 1024, 0x1000);

// Time a block of code
let timer = Timer::start("matrix_multiply");
// Do work...
timer.stop();

// Print profiling report
Profiler::global().lock().unwrap().print_report();
```

## Module Documentation

Each module has its own README with detailed documentation and is available on crates.io.

## Implementation Strategy

We follow a phased approach:

1. **Core functionality analysis**: Identify key features and APIs of each SciPy module
2. **Prioritization**: Begin with highest-demand modules (linalg, stats, optimize)
3. **Interface design**: Balance Rust idioms with SciPy compatibility
4. **Scientific computing foundation**: Implement core scientific computing modules first
5. **Advanced modules**: Implement specialized modules for advanced scientific computing
6. **AI/ML infrastructure**: Develop specialized tools for AI and machine learning
7. **Integration and optimization**: Ensure all modules work together efficiently
8. **Ecosystem development**: Create tooling, documentation, and community resources

## Core Module Usage Policy

All modules in the SciRS2 ecosystem are expected to leverage functionality from scirs2-core:

- **Validation**: Use `scirs2-core::validation` for parameter checking
- **Error Handling**: Base module-specific errors on `scirs2-core::error::CoreError`
- **Numeric Operations**: Use `scirs2-core::numeric` for generic numeric functions
- **Optimization**: Use core-provided performance optimizations:
  - SIMD operations via `scirs2-core::simd`
  - Parallelism via `scirs2-core::parallel`
  - Memory management via `scirs2-core::memory`
  - Caching via `scirs2-core::cache`

## Dependency Management

SciRS2 uses workspace inheritance for consistent dependency versioning:

- All shared dependencies are defined in the root `Cargo.toml`
- Module crates reference dependencies with `workspace = true`
- Feature-gated dependencies use `workspace = true` with `optional = true`

```toml
# In workspace root Cargo.toml
[workspace.dependencies]
ndarray = { version = "0.16.1", features = ["serde", "rayon"] }
num-complex = "0.4.3"
rayon = "1.7.0"

# In module Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
ndarray = { workspace = true }
num-complex = { workspace = true }
rayon = { workspace = true, optional = true }

[features]
parallel = ["rayon"]
```

## Core Module Usage Policy

Following the [SciRS2 Ecosystem Policy](SCIRS2_POLICY.md), all SciRS2 modules now follow a strict layered architecture:

- **Only `scirs2-core` uses external dependencies directly**
- **All other modules must use SciRS2-Core abstractions**
- **Benefits**: Consistent APIs, centralized version control, type safety, maintainability

### Required Usage Patterns

```rust
// ❌ FORBIDDEN in non-core crates
use rand::*;
use ndarray::Array2;
use num_complex::Complex;

// ✅ REQUIRED in non-core crates
use scirs2_core::random::*;
use scirs2_core::array::*;
use scirs2_core::complex::*;
```

This policy ensures ecosystem consistency and enables better optimization across the entire SciRS2 framework.

See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the complete development roadmap.

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark, GPU-only, and other environment-dependent tests are excluded from regular CI runs (59 tests marked `#[ignore]` as of the 0.6.5 ignore-legitimacy audit, each carrying a `requires-gpu:` / `requires-env:` / `slow:` / `bench:` / `not-implemented:` reason so the taxonomy is machine-checked by `cargo-scirs2-policy`'s `ignore_audit` lint) to optimize build times. Run with `cargo test -- --ignored` to execute the full test suite including benchmarks.

### Hardware-Dependent Features
- GPU acceleration features require compatible hardware and drivers
- Tests automatically fall back to CPU implementations when GPU is unavailable
- Specialized hardware support (FPGA, ASIC) uses mock implementations when hardware is not present

### Test Coverage
- Total tests: 37,442 passing across all modules with `--all-features` (35,668 with default features; plus 5,000 doc-tests)
- Regular CI tests: All passing ✅
