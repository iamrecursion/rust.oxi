//! # OxiLean
//!
//! A Pure Rust theorem prover and dependent type checker inspired by Lean 4.
//!
//! This crate is a facade that re-exports all OxiLean library components.
//! Use feature flags to select which components to include.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **`kernel`** (default) - The trusted computing base for type checking
//! - **`parse`** (default) - Concrete syntax to abstract syntax parser
//! - **`elab`** (default) - Surface syntax to kernel terms elaborator
//! - **`meta`** (default) - Metavar-aware WHNF, unification, type class synthesis, and tactics
//! - **`codegen`** - LCNF-based compilation and optimization
//! - **`runtime`** - Runtime system with GC, closures, and bytecode interpretation
//! - **`std-lib`** - Standard library (Nat, Bool, List, etc.)
//! - **`lint`** - Static analysis and lint rules
//! - **`build-sys`** - Build system with incremental compilation
//! - **`wasm`** - WebAssembly support
//! - **`full`** - All components except `wasm`
//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//! // With default features (kernel, parse, elab, meta):
//! use oxilean::kernel;
//! use oxilean::parse;
//! ```
