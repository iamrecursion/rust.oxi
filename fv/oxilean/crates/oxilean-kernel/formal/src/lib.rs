//! `oxilean-kernel-formal`: bounded model checking of `oxilean-kernel`'s
//! public `BigNat` API with [`cargo-formal`].
//!
//! This package verifies nothing about itself. It is a *specification*
//! package: [`harness`] states properties of [`oxilean_kernel::bignat::BigNat`]
//! and `cargo formal check` decides them with a bit-vector SMT solver.
//! `oxilean-kernel` is a plain path dependency and is never modified.
//!
//! # Why `BigNat`
//!
//! `bignat` is, in its own module docs, "part of the trusted computing base:
//! deliberately small, self-contained, and audited by eye". It backs
//! `Literal::Nat`, so every `Nat` literal reduction the kernel performs goes
//! through the limb arithmetic here. A carry, borrow or normalisation bug in
//! it would not be a wrong number — it would be a wrong *proof*. That makes
//! it the sharpest available self-host target, and the package sets
//! `self-host = true` in `[package.metadata.formal]` so the report says so.
//!
//! # Scope: the public API only
//!
//! Every harness calls `BigNat` through `pub` items — `from_limbs`,
//! `as_limbs`, `limb_count`, `is_zero`, `is_one`, `to_u64`, `to_u32`,
//! `bit_length`, `add`, `sub`, `beq`, `ble`, `land`, `lor`, `lxor`, `shr`,
//! and `Ord::cmp`. The limb-level helpers (`add_limbs`, `sub_limbs`,
//! `cmp_limbs`, `shl_bits`, `shr_bits`) are private and are reached only
//! *through* those entry points, which is the honest statement of what a
//! caller of the crate can rely on.
//!
//! # The three builds
//!
//! Exactly the contract `examples/checked-arith` in the `cargo-formal`
//! repository spells out, and each build proves something different:
//!
//! 1. **`cargo build`** (plain, stable). Harness bodies vanish entirely —
//!    neither `#[cfg(formal)]` nor `#[cfg(all(test, oxiformal_runtime_checks))]`
//!    applies — so this only checks that the package type-checks on stable
//!    with no warnings. `cargo test` in this mode runs the `plain_tests`
//!    module: concrete witnesses for the interesting rows plus sanity checks
//!    that pin the properties the harnesses state.
//! 2. **`RUSTFLAGS="--cfg oxiformal_runtime_checks" cargo test`**. Every
//!    harness becomes a `#[test]` that loops `oxiformal::rt::iterations`
//!    (256 by default) times through a random draw. A harness is marked
//!    `#[should_panic]` only where the randomized run really panics; none of
//!    the harnesses here is, and the report for this package records that
//!    measurement.
//! 3. **`cargo +nightly-2026-06-20 check` with `--cfg formal
//!    -Zcrate-attr=feature(register_tool) -Zcrate-attr=register_tool(formal_tool)`**
//!    and a separate `--target-dir` — exactly the flags the `cargo-formal`
//!    driver build uses. This type-checks the `#[cfg(formal)]` copy of every
//!    harness; it does not run the driver or the solver, so it says nothing
//!    about which harnesses are `proved`. That is what `EXPECTED.toml`
//!    records, **measured** by a real `cargo formal check` run.
//!
//! Then:
//!
//! ```text
//! FORMAL_DRIVER=<path to formal-driver> cargo formal check
//! ```
//!
//! # Reading a verdict
//!
//! `proved` means the solver found no input, within the harness's bounds,
//! that violates the property. `refuted` means a concrete counterexample
//! exists. `unknown` means the solver did not decide it, and its message says
//! which of the two reasons applies: `solver-model-rejected` (see below) or
//! `bounded: unwind=8 reached`. `timeout` means the 30 000 ms budget ran out
//! before any answer. `unsupported` means the encoder could not build a
//! verification condition at all, and is a statement about the encoder (or
//! about a deliberate soundness rule), never about the code.
//!
//! # Measured result (2026-09-14)
//!
//! 188 VCs over 190 obligations in 615 s, **exit 0**: 3 proved /
//! **0 refuted** / 118 unknown (25 `solver-model-rejected`, 93 `bounded`) /
//! 67 timeout / 2 unsupported (`width` and `iterator`). Nine of the eleven
//! harnesses encode completely; the two that do not are
//! `add_reaches_the_u128_carry_harness` (design rule W, the `u128` carry in
//! `add_limbs`) and `bitwise_ops_respect_the_limb_count_lattice_harness`
//! (`map`/`collect` outside the iteration model). `EXPECTED.toml` carries the
//! per-property table and `README.md` the narrative.
//!
//! **The `unknown`/`timeout` boundary is load-sensitive.** It is a wall clock,
//! not a property of the verification conditions: three runs of this source
//! with the same pins reported 124/61, 101/84 and 118/67 over the same 190
//! obligations. An obligation can only trade `unknown` for `timeout` and back,
//! never for `proved` or `refuted`, because a `bounded`/`solver-model-rejected`
//! verdict is a real answer and a `timeout` is the absence of one. A re-run
//! that reports a different split is reproducing this package, not regressing
//! it. `EXPECTED.toml`'s LOAD SENSITIVITY section has the table and names the
//! rows nearest the boundary.
//!
//! # Why so little is `proved`: cargo-formal is pinned to OxiZ 0.3.3
//!
//! `cargo-formal` depends on the SMT solver `oxiz` at a crates.io pin of
//! `=0.3.3`, which answers `sat` with a model that does not satisfy the
//! formula for a class of Boolean-structure-over-bit-vector queries
//! (upstream item U-Z10). `cargo-formal` runs a **mandatory model check** on
//! every reported counterexample, so such an answer is reported as `unknown`
//! and never as a `refuted` with a fabricated witness. Those 25 obligations
//! are labelled `solver-model-rejected` in the report and in `EXPECTED.toml`,
//! 18 of the 93 `bounded` ones are downstream of them: they name
//! `from_limbs`'s normalisation loop, whose own `unwinding-assertion` is
//! model-rejected, and where the encoder cannot conclude "the loop finished"
//! every obligation on the truncated path is `bounded` too. (The other 75 name
//! `shr_bits`'s or `cmp_limbs`'s loops, whose unwinding assertions time out
//! instead — those sit downstream of the budget, not of the pin.) None of it
//! is an encoder gap, and the pin's share moves once the pin does.
//!
//! The 67 `timeout`s are a different matter and are not the pin's fault: they
//! are genuinely hard bit-blasting problems in the eight-fold unrolled
//! two-vector walks of `cmp_limbs` and `sub_limbs`, 55 of them in the single
//! `sub`/`ble` harness.
//!
//! # What this package caught
//!
//! On 2026-09-09 it reported a `refuted` `bounds-check` on
//! `BigNat::from_limbs`, with the counterexample `in0 = vec![]`. The kernel is
//! not wrong; the **verifier** was. The cause was in cargo-formal's
//! `resolve_referents`, which resolved dead enum payloads under an un-narrowed
//! guard, so a dead `Some` from `slice::last` on an empty constant-length
//! vector raised a `bounds-check` that folds to false under a reachable guard.
//! Payloads are now resolved under `guard AND discr = d` and slots under
//! `guard AND k < len`; the obligation is removed, not proved. Six regression
//! tests pin it, and `refuted` has been **0** in every run since. That is what
//! `self-host = true` is for; `README.md` tells the whole story.
