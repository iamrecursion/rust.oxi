//! Replay: drive an `oxilean_kernel` [`Environment`] from parsed declarations.
//!
//! Replay is a **true checker**: the environment starts *empty* and every
//! constant must be introduced by the export file itself (lean4export emits
//! the full transitive closure of a declaration, so a valid export is
//! self-contained). Nothing is pre-seeded and nothing is trusted:
//!
//! * Axioms, definitions, theorems and opaques go through the kernel's
//!   `check_constant_info` (type-checks and adds to the env).
//! * `inductive` bundles are checked as a family
//!   (`check_and_derive_family`: telescopes, universes, WHNF-hardened strict
//!   positivity) and installed with the exported declarations, each
//!   re-verified by the kernel; exported **recursors are never trusted** —
//!   the kernel re-derives them and requires a definitional match.
//! * `quot` records install the four `#QUOT` primitives via the kernel's
//!   once-only `Environment::add_quot` (kernel-constructed canonical types);
//!   each exported record is then validated against the installed primitive.
//! * The `Quot.sound` **axiom** (a plain axiom record in exports) is validated
//!   against the kernel's canonical soundness type — an export cannot smuggle
//!   an arbitrary assertion under that trusted name.
//!
//! ## Three buckets
//!
//! Every declaration lands in exactly one bucket ([`ReplayOutcome`]):
//!
//! * `Checked` — the kernel accepted it.
//! * `Unsupported { feature }` — valid Lean the kernel cannot replay *yet*,
//!   with a named feature (currently: [`NESTED_INDUCTIVES`]; plus
//!   [`DEFERRED_DEPENDENCY`] for declarations that only fail because they
//!   depend on an unsupported one).
//! * `Rejected { reason }` — the kernel judged it ill-typed (or it depends on
//!   a rejected declaration; the reason names the root cause).
//!
//! ## Corpus-scale replay
//!
//! [`replay_streaming`] replays straight from a reader without retaining
//! declarations, under explicit [`ReplayLimits`] (reader node budget + an
//! optional advisory per-declaration time budget). See
//! [`crate::Limits::corpus`] for the documented whole-corpus preset.
