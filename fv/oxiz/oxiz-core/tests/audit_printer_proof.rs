//! Regression tests for the proof printer
//! (`oxiz-core/src/smtlib/printer/proof.rs`).
//!
//! `Printer::write_proof_node` used to be plain native recursion with no
//! depth guard, called once per proof-tree level, so a sufficiently deep
//! proof chain could overflow a worker thread's native stack -- a fatal
//! process abort, not a catchable error. It also re-wrote a shared premise's
//! entire subtree once per parent that referenced it, which is exponential in
//! the depth of the sharing and, independent of that cost, emitted more than
//! one `(step @pN ...)` declaration for the same `@pN` -- already-malformed
//! output, since a step id is meant to be declared once and referenced by id
//! thereafter.
//!
//! Both defects are fixed by converting the walk to an explicit
//! `(ProofId, indent)` stack with a `visited` set. These tests pin:
//!
//! 1. A small shared-premise ("diamond") DAG prints each step exactly once
//!    while still recording every `:premises` reference (behavior
//!    preservation on a case a human can check by hand).
//! 2. A long linear premise chain (depth 100,000) and a DAG with 40 levels of
//!    doubled sharing (which is where the old code's exponential re-expansion
//!    would bite) both return -- and print each node exactly once -- on a
//!    thread with a 1 MiB stack.
