//! Constant evaluation for the SMT-LIB `UnicodeStrings` comparison and
//! character-code operations.
//!
//! Every function here is a pure, directly unit-testable implementation of one
//! operator's semantics on fully known operands.  Keeping them out of
//! `builder.rs` mirrors the sibling `bv_fold` module and gives the term builder, the
//! rewriter, the model evaluator and the ground string decision procedure a
//! *single* definition to route through, so their edge cases cannot drift
//! apart.
//!
//! Reference: Z3's `seq_rewriter.cpp` (`mk_str_lt`, `mk_str_le`,
//! `mk_str_to_code`, `mk_str_from_code`) folds exactly these operations.
//!
//! The subtleties the SMT-LIB Unicode Strings theory pins down, and that are
//! easy to get wrong:
//!
//! * The order is over **code points**, not over UTF-8 bytes.  The two orders
//!   happen to agree (UTF-8 is an order-preserving prefix code), but
//!   [`str_lt`] compares `chars()` explicitly so the property is not silently
//!   relied upon.
//! * [`str_to_code`] is `-1` for *every* string that is not exactly one
//!   character long — including the empty string.
//! * [`str_from_code`] is `""` outside the alphabet `[0, 0x2FFFF]`, not an
//!   error and not a saturating value.
