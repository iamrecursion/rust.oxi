//! Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD).
//!
//! CAD is a fundamental algorithm for quantifier elimination over real closed fields.
//! It decomposes R^n into cylindrically arranged cells where polynomials have constant signs.
//!
//! ## Algorithm Phases
//!
//! 1. **Projection**: Eliminate variables recursively to reach R^1
//! 2. **Base**: Decompose R^1 based on projection polynomials
//! 3. **Lifting**: Lift decomposition back up to R^n
//!
