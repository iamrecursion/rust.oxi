//! Term parsing for the SMT-LIB2 parser.
//!
//! Terms are parsed **iteratively**, by an explicit frame stack held on the
//! heap, rather than by recursive descent. `(- (- (- ... )))` nested a million
//! levels deep therefore costs a million `Vec` entries and a constant number of
//! native stack frames, instead of a million native frames.
//!
//! That matters because a library cannot know how much stack its caller has.
//! The recursive-descent version of this parser needed roughly 2.9 KiB of
//! native stack per nesting level in the release profile, so the nesting limit
//! below (1024) needed a 3 MiB stack to reach — more than the ~2 MiB a libtest
//! thread gets, and far more than the ~1 MiB an embedder's worker thread may
//! have. Past that point the process died of a stack overflow *before* the
//! limit could report an error, which is exactly the failure mode the limit
//! exists to prevent. Making the walk iterative removes the dependence on the
//! caller's stack size entirely; the limit stays as a resource bound.
//!
//! Reference: Z3's `smt2parser.cpp` parses expressions the same way, with an
//! explicit frame stack (`m_stack`) and result stack (`expr_stack()`) driven by
//! a single loop in `parse_expr`.
