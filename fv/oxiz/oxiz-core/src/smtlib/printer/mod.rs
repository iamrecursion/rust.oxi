/// Render a bit-vector constant as a well-formed SMT-LIB2 literal.
///
/// Two invariants are enforced here, because every printer used to get both
/// of them wrong:
///
/// * **Unsigned, width-bounded value.**  A bit-vector literal denotes an
///   unsigned number in `[0, 2^width)`.  Values reaching the printer can fall
///   outside that range (the BV theory's integer relaxation can hand back a
///   negative or oversized value), which previously printed as nonsense such
///   as `#x-1`.  The value is therefore reduced modulo `2^width` first, which
///   is exactly the two's-complement wrap SMT-LIB prescribes.  The wrap
///   itself lives in [`crate::ast::bv_wrap_unsigned`], shared with the term
///   builder and the solver's model builder so the three cannot drift apart.
/// * **Radix matching the width.**  The `#x` form denotes exactly
///   `4 * digits` bits, so it is only usable when `width` is a multiple of
///   four; any other width must use the `#b` form with exactly `width` binary
///   digits.  Emitting `#x` with `width.div_ceil(4)` digits (as the printers
///   previously did) silently widens e.g. a 5-bit value to 8 bits.
///
/// # `#x` is a canonicalization choice, `#b` is forced
///
/// The `#b` half of the radix rule is forced: a hex digit *is* four bits, so
/// there is no legal `#x` spelling at all at a width that is not a multiple of
/// four.  The `#x` half is a choice — `#b` with exactly `width` digits is
/// valid SMT-LIB at *every* width, multiples of four included — and this
/// function is where that choice is made, once, for the whole workspace.  It
/// matches what Z3 prints.  Legitimate `#b` output elsewhere, such as the
/// `(fp #b.. #b.. #b..)` bit-triples in this module's pretty printer, denotes
/// a different construct and must stay `#b`.
///
/// # Why this is `pub`
///
/// Every bit-vector *value* rendered anywhere in the workspace must come from
/// here, or the same constant comes back spelled two ways.  That is exactly
/// what finding U-Z13 was: an 8-bit constant printed `#x05` by `(get-value)`,
/// which reached this function, and `#b00000101` by `(get-model)`, which had a
/// hand-rolled `format!("#b{:0>width$}", ..)` of its own.  Callers that hold a
/// [`crate::ast::TermManager`] can print the interned constant through
/// [`Printer`]; callers that only have a value and a width — such as
/// `oxiz-solver`'s `Context::default_value`, which holds `&self` and cannot
/// intern anything — call this directly.
pub fn format_bitvec_literal(value: &num_bigint::BigInt, width: u32) -> String {
    // Width 0 is not a legal SMT-LIB bit-vector sort; there is no literal
    // syntax for it, so fall back to the shortest well-formed binary literal
    // rather than emit a zero-digit `#x`/`#b` token that no parser accepts.

/// Render a string value as a well-formed SMT-LIB2 string literal, including
/// the enclosing double quotes.
///
/// This is the inverse of the lexer's literal decoding
/// ([`crate::smtlib::Lexer`]), and the single place any string value is turned
/// back into source text — every printer routes through it so the three copies
/// that used to exist cannot drift apart again.
///
/// # The rules
///
/// SMT-LIB 2.6 is not C: **a backslash is not an escape introducer** and there
/// is no `\"` and no `\\`.  The only in-literal escape the core language
/// defines is the doubled quote, and the Unicode Strings theory adds exactly
/// two `\u` forms *on input*:
///
/// * `"` is written `""` — one quote character.  The old `\"` re-parsed as a
///   backslash followed by the end of the literal, silently truncating the
///   value and corrupting the rest of the output.
/// * `\` stands for itself and is emitted verbatim, **unless** the character
///   after it is `u`, in which case the reader would try to read a `\u`
///   escape; the backslash is then written `\u{5c}`.  This is the only
///   situation in which a backslash needs any treatment at all.  The old
///   `\\` re-parsed as *two* backslashes.
/// * Every code point outside printable ASCII (`0x20..=0x7E`) is written
///   `\u{...}` in lowercase hexadecimal, so the output is portable ASCII.
///   Emitting the raw UTF-8 bytes (as the printers used to) is read back by
///   Z3 as one character *per byte*, so `é` came back as two characters.
///
/// The escape forms recognised on input are `\ud₃d₂d₁d₀` (exactly four hex
/// digits) and `\u{d...}` (one to five hex digits); both denote a code point
/// in `0..=0x2FFFF`.  The `\u{...}` form emitted here is therefore always
/// read back as the single character it denotes, for every `char` up to the
/// lexer's `MAX_STRING_CODE_POINT`.
///
/// Rust's `char` excludes the UTF-16 surrogate range `0xD800..=0xDFFF` by
/// construction, so this function can never emit a surrogate escape — which
/// is exactly the range the lexer rejects as unrepresentable, so the two
/// layers agree on the alphabet.
///
/// Reference: Z3's `zstring.cpp` (`zstring::encode`) and `ast_smt2_pp.cpp`
/// (`smt2_pp_environment::pp_string_literal`), which apply these two steps in
/// the same order.
///
/// # Limitation
///
/// A `char` above `MAX_STRING_CODE_POINT` (`0x2FFFF`) is outside the alphabet
/// of the Unicode Strings theory and has *no* literal spelling: a `\u{...}`
/// escape denoting a larger value is not an escape sequence at all, so no
/// reader — Z3's or OxiZ's — would read it back as one character.  Such a
/// value can only arise from a raw supplementary-plane character in the
/// input; it is still written as `\u{...}` here, since there is no
/// alternative encoding and the escape at least names the code point.
