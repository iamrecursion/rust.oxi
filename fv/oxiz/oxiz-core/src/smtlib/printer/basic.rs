/// Maximum `write_term` recursion depth before printing degrades to a
/// truncation marker instead of continuing to descend, mirroring the depth
/// cap `simplification`'s `SIMPLIFICATION_MAX_DEPTH` applies elsewhere in
/// the crate. (An earlier version of this comment also pointed to
/// `ast::manager::query::MAX_QUERY_RECURSION_DEPTH`; that cap was removed
/// when `TermManager::substitute`/`simplify`/`free_vars` were converted to
/// use an explicit heap stack instead, which needs no depth cap at all --
/// it no longer exists.) Terms built directly via the `mk_*` builder API
/// bypass parser-/rewriter-side caps like `SIMPLIFICATION_MAX_DEPTH`, so
/// without a bound here, printing a pathologically deep (but validly
/// constructed) term could overflow the native call stack. `write_term`
/// itself is *not* converted to an explicit-stack walk the way the
/// `TermManager` methods above were -- unlike those, a decision was made
/// to keep this guard rather than rewrite the printer, based on a direct
/// measurement (see below) rather than assumption.
///
/// # Measured stack cost (why 2000 is not just an assumed-safe round number)
///
/// A prior audit suspected 2000 frames of `write_term`/`write_term_at_depth`
/// might not fit in the 1 MiB thread stacks this workspace's own deep-term
/// regression tests deliberately constrain themselves to (see
/// `run_on_1mib_stack` in `ast/manager/query/tests.rs`), which is exactly
/// the failure mode that forced the SMT-LIB parser's own recursion-to-
/// iteration rewrite (there, roughly 2944 bytes/frame x 1024 levels needed
/// ~2.9 MiB, well past a 1-2 MiB budget). That suspicion does not hold here:
/// measured by binary-searching (via a chain of nested `not`s, built with
/// `intern` to bypass `mk_not`'s double-negation simplification, printed on
/// a thread with an explicitly bounded stack, with `MAX_PRINT_DEPTH`
/// temporarily raised far out of the way to observe genuine unguarded
/// native recursion) for the exact depth at which a real stack overflow
/// occurs:
///
/// | Profile (this workspace's `Cargo.toml`) | Stack size | Last safe depth | First crashing depth |
/// |---|---|---|---|
/// | `release` (`opt-level = "z"`, the profile `--release` actually uses here) | 1 MiB | 4,414 | 4,415 |
/// | `release` | 2 MiB | 8,783 | 8,784 |
/// | `dev` (`opt-level = 1`, what plain `cargo test` uses here) | 1 MiB | 3,999 | 4,000 |
///
/// The release-mode data points solve to **~240 bytes/frame** (per
/// print-recursion level, i.e. one `write_term` + `write_term_at_depth`
/// pair combined: `(2 MiB - 1 MiB) / (8784 - 4415) ~ 240`), an order of
/// magnitude leaner than the parser's ~2944 bytes/frame (printing a term
/// only ever holds a handful of small locals per level -- an `&str`
/// keyword and the args being written -- versus a parser frame's richer
/// per-level state). `MAX_PRINT_DEPTH = 2000` therefore leaves roughly a
/// 2x safety margin below the measured crash point in *both* profiles this
/// workspace's own commands exercise (`cargo test` and `cargo test
/// --release`), not merely in whichever one happens to be faster to
/// build -- so, unlike the stale suspicion above, this guard is confirmed
/// to actually fire before a real overflow rather than merely being
/// assumed to. See `write_term_truncates_on_a_constrained_stack_without_overflowing`
