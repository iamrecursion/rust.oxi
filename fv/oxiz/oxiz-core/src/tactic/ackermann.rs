    /// themselves ground: an application `f(x)` whose argument `x` is bound by
    /// an enclosing `forall`/`exists` denotes a *different* value for each
    /// binding of `x`, so collapsing it into one ground variable (and adding
    /// ground congruence constraints) is unsound.
    ///
    /// An application whose arguments reference any quantifier-bound variable
    /// is therefore **not** collected; instead its function symbol is recorded
    /// in `tainted`. The caller then drops *every* application of a tainted
    /// symbol — even its ground occurrences — because Ackermannizing only some
    /// occurrences of `f` while leaving quantified ones as real `f` would
    /// decouple the fresh variables from `f` (the linking constraint
    /// `v_a = f(a)` is absent), again unsoundly. If nothing survives, the
    /// tactic is `NotApplicable`.
    ///
    /// # Why `bound_names` is goal-global rather than scope-tracked
    ///
    /// This used to carry a `bound: &mut Vec<Spur>` push/truncate scope stack
    /// so that a name only counted as bound *within* its binder. Combined
    /// with the `visited` memo — which is keyed on `TermId` alone and shared
    /// across the whole goal — that was unsound: because terms are
    /// hash-consed, a subterm `f(x)` occurring both at the top level and
    /// inside `(forall ((x Int)) ...)` is one single `TermId`. Whichever
    /// occurrence was reached first won; if that was the top-level one, the
    /// walk recorded `f(x)` as a ground application and `visited` then
    /// suppressed the quantified occurrence that would have tainted `f`. The
    /// rewrite step replaces terms by `TermId`, so `f(x)` inside the binder
    /// was replaced by the ground fresh variable too — exactly the unsoundness
    /// the taint mechanism exists to prevent.
    ///
    /// `bound_names` is now the set of *every* name bound by *any*
    /// quantifier anywhere in the goal (see
    /// [`Self::collect_bound_names`]). That is a deliberate
    /// over-approximation: a symbol applied to a free variable that merely
    /// happens to share a name with some unrelated binder elsewhere is
    /// tainted and left alone. Over-tainting only makes the tactic decline to
    /// eliminate a symbol (incompleteness, reported honestly as
    /// `NotApplicable`), whereas under-tainting corrupts the formula — and it
    /// makes the scope-insensitive `visited` memo correct by construction,
    /// since "does this term reference a bound name" no longer depends on the
    /// path by which the term was reached.

    /// # Iterative walk
    ///
    /// The descent uses an explicit heap stack: the return type is `()`, so a
    /// depth cap could only silently stop collecting applications partway
    /// through — leaving some occurrences of `f` Ackermannized and others
    /// not, which is precisely the decoupling described above. Children come

    /// exhaustively; the previous hand-written match ended in `_ => {}` and so
