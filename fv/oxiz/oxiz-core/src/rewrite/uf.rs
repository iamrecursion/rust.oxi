//! Uninterpreted Function Rewriter
//!
//! This module provides rewriting rules for uninterpreted functions:
//! - Function congruence: f(a) = f(a) → true
//! - Argument simplification
//! - Beta reduction for lambda expressions
//! - Function application normalization
//! - Constant propagation through functions
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use oxiz_core::rewrite::{Rewriter, RewriteContext, UfRewriter};
//!
//! let mut ctx = RewriteContext::new();
//! let mut uf = UfRewriter::new();
//! let simplified = uf.rewrite(term, &mut ctx, &mut manager)?;
//! ```

/// `UfRewriter`'s internal substitution now delegates to
/// [`TermManager::substitute`],
/// which walks an explicit heap stack and so has no depth to bound, and a
