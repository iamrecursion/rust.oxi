//! ML-guided tactic selection wiring for `--ml-tactic-selection`.
//!
//! This is the CLI's integration point for the `oxiz-ml` crate: before a
//! solve it extracts formula features and asks the ML engine to recommend a
//! tactic, applies a conservative (correctness-preserving) solver option for
//! that tactic, and after the solve records the outcome so the model learns.
//! The learned model is persisted to (and reloaded from) a JSON file under the
//! user config directory, so learning accumulates across invocations.
//!
//! The flag is **off by default**; when off, none of this runs and the solve
//! is byte-for-byte unchanged.
