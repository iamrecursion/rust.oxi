//! Regression: `solve_with_theory` must never answer `Sat` with Boolean
//! propagation left un-run.
//!
//! The CDCL(T) loop handles a theory conflict by backtracking, learning the
//! analysed clause and putting its asserting literal on the trail — for a unit
//! lemma, a brand-new **level-0 fact**. That literal is appended *unpropagated*.
//! The theory-conflict branches used to rejoin the inner theory loop, which does
//! not run BCP; only the outer search loop does. As long as some variable was
//! still open the gap closed itself, because the next decision fell through to
//! the outer loop and propagation caught up. But when the theory conflict
//! resolved the **last** unassigned variable, `pick_branch_var` reported "all
//! assigned" and the loop went straight to `final_check`. The theory saw a
//! consistent set of atoms and said `Sat`, and `solve_with_theory` returned that
//! `Sat` over a trail on which an **original** clause was already falsified by
//! level-0 facts alone — a total model that does not satisfy the input formula,
//! on an instance that is in fact `Unsat`.
//!
//! Reference: Z3's `smt_context.cpp`, whose `final_check` is likewise only
//! reached from a state where `propagate()` has reached a fixpoint.
