//! Regression: a theory conflict clause that still lists an UNASSIGNED literal
//! must not crash or corrupt the CDCL(T) trail.
//!
//! The MBQI / quantifier-instantiation layer builds its conflict clause from a
//! per-atom polarity map that is not pruned on every SAT backtrack (a restart in
//! particular). It can therefore report a "conflict" whose clause contains a
//! variable the SAT core has since unassigned — the literal is not falsified, so
//! the clause is really an *asserting lemma* (unit under the current assignment),
//! not a conflict. Feeding that into the all-false 1-UIP machinery used to
//! duplicate the asserting literal at the backtrack level, tripping the theory
//! trail-consistency `debug_assert` in `oxiz-sat/src/solver/conflict.rs`
//! (panic in debug) and producing a wrong top-level UNSAT in release.
//!
//! These tests drive the real [`Solver::solve_with_theory`] loop with a mock
//! theory that reports exactly such a clause, and assert the solver survives and
//! returns a sound verdict.
