//! Incremental-probe state management.
//!
//! These helpers let a caller that drives the solver *incrementally* — asserting
//! more clauses and calling [`Solver::solve`] repeatedly — roll the search state
//! back to the committed (asserted) prefix after each probe.  They exist for the
//! bit-vector theory's embedded solver (`BvSolver::check`), whose probe pattern
//! exposes two ways a probe's residue can otherwise stay behind and turn a
//! genuinely-satisfiable formula into a false `Unsat`: the satisfying model left
//! on the trail (see [`Solver::restore_to_trail_size`]) and clauses learned while
//! an unjustified level-0 unit constraint was on the trail (see
//! [`Solver::forget_learned_since`]).
