//! Runtime invariant checks for the CDCL SAT solver.
//!
//! This module is a debug-only structural/soundness net over [`Solver`]'s
//! internal data model: the clause database, the assignment trail, the
//! two-watched-literal scheme, the implication graph, and learned-clause
//! bookkeeping (LBD). Every function here is a pure, read-only check that
//! returns `Err(String)` describing the first violation found, or `Ok(())`.
//! None of them mutate the solver and none of them are ever called outside
//! `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]` call sites (see the `debug_check_*` wrapper
//! methods next to [`Solver::debug_verify_model`] in `solver::learn`), so
//! this module costs nothing in release builds.
//!
//! # Two families of check: timeless vs. situational
//!
//! Some invariants hold at *any* point in the search and are grouped into
//! [`check_all_sat_invariants`]: clause well-formedness, trail/assignment
//! consistency, decision-level bookkeeping, static LBD bounds, live reason
//! clauses, and implication-graph acyclicity.
//!
//! Others are only meaningful at a *specific* moment and are deliberately
//! **not** part of that sweep:
//!
//! - [`check_watched_literals`] and [`check_unit_propagation_complete`] only
//!   hold once `propagate()` has reached a fixpoint (returned `None`); mid-scan,
//!   `propagate()` routinely leaves a literal's watch list half-examined (see
//!   `Trail::requeue_last_propagated`), which would make these checks fire on
//!   perfectly correct in-progress states.
//! - [`check_conflict_clause`] only holds against the exact assignment that
//!   produced a conflict, before any backtrack changes the trail.
//! - [`check_restart_consistency`] only holds immediately after a restart
//!   (which backtracks to level 0).
//! - [`check_learned_clause_lbd`] only holds in the instant right after a
//!   clause is learned; see its own doc comment for why it cannot be a
//!   whole-database sweep.
//!
//! # A finding from wiring this module in: the ported "monotonic trail" check
//! was wrong
//!
//! This file originally asserted that decision levels are non-decreasing
//! along the trail. That is false for this solver: chronological
//! backtracking (`SolverConfig::enable_chronological_backtrack`, **on** by
//! default) deliberately records a propagated literal at a level *below* the
//! decision level the search currently sits at (see
//! `Trail::assign_propagation_at` and `Trail::backtrack_to_with_callback`'s
//! own doc comments -- the trail is explicitly documented there as *not*
//! sorted by level). Reintroducing that assertion would fail on entirely
//! correct solver behavior every time chronological backtracking actually
//! fires. [`check_decision_levels`] therefore only checks the invariant that
//! *does* hold unconditionally: no trail entry's level exceeds the current
//! decision level.
//!
//! Similarly, the ported "LBD must be positive" check would fire on every
//! unit learned clause: `Solver::solve`'s `len() == 1` branch stores the unit
//! fact directly and never calls `compute_lbd`, so such a clause's `lbd`
//! field legitimately stays at its default of `0`. [`check_learned_clause_bounds`]
//! excludes unit clauses to match that convention instead of flagging it.
