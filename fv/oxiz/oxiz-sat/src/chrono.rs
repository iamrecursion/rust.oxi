//! Chronological backtracking support
//!
//! Chronological backtracking (Nadel & Ryvchin, *Chronological Backtracking*,
//! SAT 2018; refined by Möhle & Biere, *Backing Backtracking*, SAT 2019) trades
//! the textbook backjump for a one-level rollback: instead of jumping all the
//! way down to the learned clause's assertion level `a`, the solver backtracks
//! only to `conflict_level - 1` and keeps every decision in between.  That saves
//! the work of re-deriving all the propagations those decisions imply, which is
//! exactly the win when the backjump would otherwise be very deep.
//!
//! Two invariants make this sound, and both live outside this module:
//!
//! * the asserting literal must be assigned at its **true** implication level
//!   (the maximum level over the learned clause's remaining literals), not at
//!   the level the search happens to sit at after the rollback — see
//!   [`crate::trail::Trail::assign_propagation_at`]; and
//! * the trail is consequently no longer sorted by decision level, so rollback
//!   filters by level instead of truncating — see
//!   [`crate::trail::Trail::backtrack_to_with_callback`] — and the solver's
//!   1-UIP conflict analysis skips trail literals that are not at the conflict
//!   level.
//!
//! A **unit** learned clause is never backtracked chronologically: it is a
//! consequence of the formula alone and belongs at level 0.
