//! Harnesses over the **public** `oxiz-sat` literal API.
//!
//! Nothing in this file is a copy of `oxiz-sat`: every target is called
//! through the real crate's public interface (`oxiz_sat::{Lit, Var, LBool}`,
//! re-exported from the private module `oxiz-sat/src/literal.rs` at
//! `oxiz-sat/src/lib.rs:227`), and `cargo-formal` lowers the reachable bodies
//! of that crate into the verification conditions (19 dependency bodies
//! lowered, all 19 reachable, in the run recorded in `README.md`).
//!
//! `Lit` packs a variable index and a sign into one `u32` as
//! `index << 1 | sign`, and `to_dimacs`/`from_dimacs` carry that packing
//! across the DIMACS boundary. Both encodings are total only for
//! `index <= Var::MAX_INDEX` (`= (1 << 31) - 2`), which is simultaneously the
//! largest index the shift can hold and the largest index whose DIMACS form
//! `index + 1` has an `i32` negation. The pair
//! `lit_pos_roundtrip_bounded_harness` / `lit_pos_roundtrip_unbounded_harness`
//! states exactly that: the round trip under the bound, and the bound's
//! necessity without it.
//!
//! Every entry point states the property it raises and the **measured** L1
//! verdict for it; `EXPECTED.toml` at the package root mirrors the same table
//! machine-readably, and `README.md` names the run that produced it. The
//! contract twins of these nine harnesses -- the same nine properties written
//! as `#[requires]`/`#[ensures]` on wrapper functions, each with its own
//! `#[proof_for_contract]` harness -- live in [`crate::spec`].
//!
//! | Specimen | What it exercises | Measured outcomes |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `Lit::pos`/`neg`/`var`/`code`/`from_code`/`negate` | the `index << 1 \| sign` packing and the bound it needs | `proved`, `refuted` |
//! | `Lit::from_dimacs`/`to_dimacs`/`try_to_dimacs` | the DIMACS boundary, including the inputs that have no literal | `proved`, `refuted` |
//! | `LBool` | the three-valued assignment the CDCL loop reads | `unknown` (the solver, not the encoder -- see `README.md`) |
//!
//! Values are compared through `.code()`, `.var().0` and the `is_*`
//! predicates rather than with `==` on `Lit`/`Var`/`LBool`. That is
//! deliberate: `==` on those types goes through their *derived* `PartialEq`
//! impls, which only have MIR in the module set if dependency-body lowering
//! reaches derive-generated impls. Writing the properties over the `u32` and
//! `bool` observers makes every harness independent of that question, and
//! costs nothing -- the packing is the property.
//!
//! A bare `debug_assert!` lowers to `core::panicking::panic`, so the property
//! key for one is `panic`, not `assert`. Six of the measured rows below carry
//! that key, over eight obligations -- six `debug_assert!` expansions and two
//! reaches of `to_dimacs`'s documented unconditional panic -- and they are the
//! interesting ones: they are the checks the upstream fix added, and both
//! refutations are among them.
