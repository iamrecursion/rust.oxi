//! Cross-environment verdict-agreement check for the tracked parity records.
//!
//! # The invariant this pins
//!
//! `bench/z3_parity` commits one tracked record per environment,
//! `results.<os>-<arch>.json` (currently `results.macos-aarch64.json` and
//! `results.linux-x86_64.json`). Those files are the evidence behind the
//! published "168/168 Correct" parity claim, and the rule that makes them
//! usable as evidence is:
//!
//! > Every tracked `results.<os>-<arch>.json` must agree on the VERDICT of
//! > every benchmark (`oxiz_result`, `z3_result`, `match_status`). Timings
//! > (`oxiz_time`, `z3_time`) are machine-dependent and are expected to
//! > differ.
//!
//! This test is the standing enforcement of that rule.
//!
//! # Why it exists
//!
//! The layout used to be a single tracked `bench/z3_parity/results.json`,
//! cited everywhere as *the* authoritative result while it actually held
//! "whatever machine ran last". On 2026-07-31 a Linux run overwrote
//! macOS-recorded numbers and nothing in the file signalled it — a run on
//! one platform could silently overwrite another platform's recorded
//! evidence, and a genuine cross-platform verdict divergence would have
//! been indistinguishable from a routine re-run. `results.json` is now the
//! untracked scratch output of a local run, each environment commits its
//! own record, and this test is what notices when two of those records
//! stop telling the same story.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! None worth mentioning: this reads committed JSON only. No `z3` binary,
//! no solving, no benchmark execution — it runs anywhere `cargo test`
//! runs, including machines that have never had Z3 installed.
