//! OxiZ vs Z3 parity-testing library.
//!
//! Hosts the shared types behind two independent consumers:
//!
//! - The curated benchmark-suite runner driven by `src/main.rs` (fixed
//!   `.smt2` corpora under `benchmarks/`, see `METHODOLOGY.md`).
//! - The deterministic differential-testing harness (`generator` +
//!   `difftest`), which generates random well-typed SMT-LIB2 scripts per
//!   logic and checks OxiZ's sat/unsat verdicts against a Z3 binary found
//!   on `PATH`. See `METHODOLOGY.md`'s "Differential Testing" section for
//!   usage.
//!
//! The benchmark-suite runner serialises a [`ParityReport`] - a versioned
//! envelope pairing the raw [`ParityResult`] list with a [`RunMetadata`]
//! header describing the environment that produced it.
