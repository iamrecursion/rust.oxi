//! Regression example: verifies that a trivially unsatisfiable arithmetic
//! conjunction (`age >= 65 AND age < 18`) is correctly reported as `Unsat`.
//!
//! This was previously an orphaned file at the repository root
//! (`examples/debug_test.rs`) that was never compiled: the workspace root
//! is a virtual manifest with no `[package]`, so Cargo silently ignored it.
//! It now lives under the `oxiz` crate's `examples/` directory where
//! `cargo run --example debug_test -p oxiz` actually builds and runs it.
