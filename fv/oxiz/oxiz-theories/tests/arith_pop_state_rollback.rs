//! Regression tests for the arithmetic solver's push/pop state rollback.
//!
//! Diagnosed bug: `ArithSolver::pop()` truncated `var_to_term` but did NOT roll
//! back `term_to_var`. Because the underlying simplex recycles variable indices
//! across a pop (its per-variable arrays shrink), the stale `term_to_var`
//! entries made `intern()` replay indices that now belong to a different — or
//! not-yet-created — variable. Downstream constraints could then attach to a
//! recycled index, a correctness/performance hazard.
//!
//! These tests exercise the behaviour purely through the public API:
//! `intern()` (variable identity) and `push`/`pop`/`check` (solve verdicts).
