//! Regression tests for a P1 crash: `index out of bounds` in the Simplex
//! tableau when a variable index is handed to it without the per-variable
//! parallel arrays (`assignment`/`lower`/`upper`/`basic`) having been grown
//! for that index.
//!
//! Origin: a UFLRA problem with nested uninterpreted functions over reals,
//! solved through MBQI, backtracks (pops) the arithmetic context. A caller
//! that caches term -> variable-index mappings can then *replay* a variable
//! index that was created at a deeper level and has since been removed by the
//! pop — i.e. an index that now lies past the end of the bounds arrays. The
//! original benchmark (`bench/z3_parity/benchmarks/UFLRA/real_composition.smt2`)
//! panicked at `simplex/mod.rs` inside `can_increase` with
//! `index out of bounds: the len is N but the index is N`.
//!
//! The fix routes every variable-index-introducing code path
//! (`add_le`/`add_ge`/`add_strict_*` and every `set_lower`/`set_upper`
//! variant) through a central `ensure_var`, which grows all four parallel
//! arrays in lockstep with pop-safe undo records. These tests exercise the
//! Simplex directly at that boundary, since the panic is an internal
//! invariant of the tableau rather than a specific SMT logic.
