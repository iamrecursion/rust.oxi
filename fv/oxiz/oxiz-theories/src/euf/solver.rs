//! EUF Theory Solver
//!
//! The solver is split across three files along the seams of what each one is
//! responsible for:
//!
//! * this module — the e-graph's data model (`ENode`, the trails, the context
//!   stack), term interning, and the [`Theory`] implementation (`push`/`pop`/
//!   `reset`);
//! * [`congruence`] — everything that *mutates* the e-graph: use lists,
//!   signature-table maintenance and merge propagation;
//! * [`explain`] — everything that *justifies* a derived equality: conflict
//!   detection and proof-forest explanation.
//!
//! Reference: Z3's `euf_egraph.cpp` for the overall congruence-closure design.
