## NPM Publishing

### Setup
1. [ ] Ensure you have an NPM account

   ```bash
   npm view @cooljapan/oxiz
   ```

### Dry Run
3. [ ] Run publish dry-run
   ```bash
   npm publish --dry-run
   ```

4. [ ] Verify package contents
   - Check `files` in package.json
   - Ensure no unnecessary files are included
   - Verify WASM files are present

### Publish
5. [ ] Run the automated publish script
   ```bash
   ./publish.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Check NPM authentication
   - Verify version is not already published
   - Run tests
   - Build all targets
   - Optimize builds
   - Show package sizes
   - Run dry-run
   - Confirm before publishing
   - Create git tag
   - Publish to NPM

6. [ ] Verify publication
   ```bash
   npm view @cooljapan/oxiz
   ```

7. [ ] Push git tag
   ```bash
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

## Post-Publication

### CDN Verification
- [ ] Wait 5-10 minutes for CDN propagation

- [ ] Verify unpkg
  ```
  https://unpkg.com/@cooljapan/oxiz@X.Y.Z/
  ```

- [ ] Verify jsDelivr
  ```
  https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@cooljapan/oxiz@X.Y.Z/
  ```

- [ ] Test CDN loading
  Create a simple HTML file:
  ```html
  <script type="module">
    import init from 'https://unpkg.com/@cooljapan/oxiz@X.Y.Z/pkg/oxiz_wasm.js';
    await init();
    console.log('Loaded from CDN!');
  </script>
  ```

### GitHub Release
- [ ] Create GitHub release
  ```bash
  gh release create vX.Y.Z \
    --title "Release vX.Y.Z" \
    --notes "Release notes here"
  ```

- [ ] Attach artifacts (optional)
  - Optimized WASM binary

- [ ] Verify all documentation links work

### Announcement
- [ ] Announce on project discussion board
- [ ] Update project website (if any)
- [ ] Post on social media (if applicable)
- [ ] Update crates.io listing (if published)

## Playground Deployment

### Option 1: GitHub Pages
1. [ ] Create `gh-pages` branch
   ```bash
   git checkout --orphan gh-pages
   ```

2. [ ] Copy playground and build artifacts
   ```bash
   cp -r examples/playground.html index.html
   cp -r pkg ./
   ```

3. [ ] Commit and push
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy playground"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

4. [ ] Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - Settings > Pages
   - Source: gh-pages branch
   - Save

5. [ ] Verify deployment
   ```
   https://your-org.github.io/oxiz/
   ```

### Option 2: Netlify
1. [ ] Create `netlify.toml`
   ```toml
   [build]
     publish = "dist"
     command = "./build.sh optimized web && mkdir -p dist && cp examples/playground.html dist/index.html && cp -r pkg dist/"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/*"
     to = "/index.html"
     status = 200
   ```

2. [ ] Deploy
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```

### Option 3: Vercel
1. [ ] Install Vercel CLI

   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. [ ] Configure
   - Build Command: `./build.sh optimized web`
   - Output Directory: `pkg`

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are found after release:

### Option 1: Deprecate Version
```bash
npm deprecate @cooljapan/oxiz@X.Y.Z "This version has issues, use X.Y.Z+1 instead"
```

### Option 2: Unpublish (within 72 hours)
```bash
npm unpublish @cooljapan/oxiz@X.Y.Z
```

**Note**: Only use this for critical security issues.

### Option 3: Publish Patch
1. Fix the issue
2. Bump to X.Y.Z+1
3. Publish new version
4. Deprecate old version

## Monitoring

### Package Health
- [ ] Check NPM download stats
  ```
  https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=@cooljapan/oxiz
  ```

- [ ] Monitor GitHub issues for bug reports

- [ ] Check CDN hit rates
  ```
  https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@cooljapan/oxiz
  ```

### Performance
- [ ] Monitor bundle size over time
- [ ] Check load times in different regions
- [ ] Verify WASM execution performance

## Next Release Planning

After a successful release:

1. [ ] Create milestone for next version
2. [ ] Triage open issues
3. [ ] Plan new features
4. [ ] Update TODO.md with next priorities
5. [ ] Set up beta/alpha releases if needed

## Emergency Contacts

- NPM Support: support@npmjs.com
- GitHub Support: https://support.github.com
- CDN Issues: Check respective CDN status pages

## Notes

- Always test on a staging environment first
- Keep release notes detailed and user-friendly
- Maintain semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Coordinate releases with dependent packages
- Announce breaking changes well in advance

## Automation Ideas

Future improvements to automate:

- [ ] Automated version bumping in CI
- [ ] Automated changelog generation
- [ ] Automated browser testing in CI
- [ ] Automated CDN verification
- [ ] Automated GitHub release creation
- [ ] Automated documentation deployment
- [ ] Automated performance regression testing
