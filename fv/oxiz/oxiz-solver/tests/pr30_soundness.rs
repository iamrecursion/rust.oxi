//! Regression tests for the independently-reimplemented arith<->EUF
//! combination fixes (upstream PR #30 against cool-japan/oxiz): numeric
//! uninterpreted-function-argument purification, non-convex LIA integer
//! case-splitting, and bidirectional Nelson-Oppen equality/disequality
//! exchange.
//!
//! Lower-level, mechanism-specific tests live next to the code they
//! exercise:
//! * `oxiz-solver/src/solver/int_case_split.rs` -- the interval-arithmetic
//!   helpers (`floor_div`/`ceil_div`/`bound_from_side`/...) in isolation.
//! * `oxiz-theories/src/arithmetic/solver.rs` -- doctests/unit coverage for
//!   `entailed_equal_reason` / `entailed_disequal_reason`, if any.
//!
//! This file covers the fixes whose defining property is only visible
//! end-to-end: does the *whole solver*, driven exactly as an SMT-LIB2 client
//! would drive it, answer `sat`/`unsat` correctly, and does a satisfiable
//! model still resolve through `get-value`.
