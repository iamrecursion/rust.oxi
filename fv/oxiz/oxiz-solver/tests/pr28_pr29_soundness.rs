//! Regression tests for the independently-reimplemented EUF congruence-closure
//! soundness fixes (upstream PR #28) and Bool/EUF encoding fixes (upstream PR
//! #29) against cool-japan/oxiz.
//!
//! Lower-level, mechanism-specific tests for the same fixes live next to the
//! code they exercise:
//! * `oxiz-theories/src/euf/solver/tests.rs` -- `test_pr28_*` (sig-table
//!   staleness, the disequality watch-list, and the proof-forest spanning-
//!   forest invariant that makes PR28-4's stamped explanations unnecessary
//!   here).
//! * `oxiz-solver/src/solver/encode/bool_euf_encoding/tests.rs` -- structural
//!   tests of the two rewrite passes themselves, including the
//!   quantifier-opacity guard and the narrow `encode_nonbool_ite_equality`
//!   backstop in isolation.
//!
//! This file covers the fixes whose defining property is only visible
//! end-to-end: does the *whole solver*, driven exactly as an SMT-LIB2 client
//! would drive it, answer `sat`/`unsat` correctly.
