//! End-to-end regression tests for finite-range quantifier expansion.
//!
//! A quantifier whose own guard pins every bound Int variable to a concrete
//! finite interval is rewritten at assert time into the *logically equivalent*
//! finite conjunction (`forall`) / disjunction (`exists`) over that interval —
//! see `oxiz-solver/src/solver/encode/finite_expand.rs`.  The quantifier then
//! disappears entirely and the ordinary ground solver decides the problem, so
//! `sat` here is a genuine ground model, not an MBQI guess.
//!
//! Two halves are pinned:
//!
//! * `*_sat` — the satisfiable goals the expansion makes decidable, including
//!   the three `bench/z3_parity/benchmarks/AUFLIA` scripts the capability was
//!   built for (`z3_parity_*`);
//! * `*_unsat` / soundness — the same machinery must never turn a satisfiable
//!   goal into a spurious `unsat` (the rewrite is an equivalence, so *both*
//!   directions are pinned), and must decline every shape whose bounds are not
//!   provably concrete.
