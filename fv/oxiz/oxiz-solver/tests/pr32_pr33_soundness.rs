//! Regression tests for the independently-reimplemented lookup-table
//! flattening / domain-first branching fixes (upstream PR #32 against
//! cool-japan/oxiz) and the equality-logic transitivity preprocessor
//! (upstream PR #33).
//!
//! Lower-level, mechanism-specific tests live next to the code they
//! exercise:
//! * `oxiz-solver/src/solver/encode/finite_map_ite/tests.rs` -- spine
//!   detection and the index/domain bookkeeping in isolation
//!   (`lookup_index_terms` is crate-private and unreachable from here).
//! * `oxiz-solver/src/solver/eq_skeleton/tests.rs` -- purity-detection edge
//!   cases and, critically, the post-solve re-verification actually
//!   refusing a deliberately inconsistent assignment (the model backstop's
//!   *firing* path, which needs white-box access to force).
//!
//! This file covers the fixes whose defining property is only visible
//! end-to-end: does the *whole solver*, driven exactly as an SMT-LIB2 client
//! would drive it, answer `sat`/`unsat` correctly, and does `get-value`
//! still resolve the terms a user actually wrote (not the internal
//! rewritten form).
