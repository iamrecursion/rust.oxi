//! The verdict cache's contract with its callers.
//!
//! Three things have to hold for [`super::GoalFingerprint`] to be allowed to
//! short-circuit a search, and each gets a pin here:
//!
//! 1. **A hit answers the question that was asked.**  The cached verdict must
//!    agree with what a solver that never saw the earlier call would say.
//! 2. **A settings change is not "nothing happened".**  Every mutator of
//!    something a `check` reads must make the next `check` run for real —
//!    mechanically, so a setter added later cannot quietly opt out.
//! 3. **The observable consequences of a re-run actually arrive.**  A verdict is
//!    not the only output: turning unsat-core production on after a cached
//!    `Unsat`, or raising a budget after a cached `Unknown`, has to produce the
//!    core and the real answer rather than replay the old verdict.
//!
//! (2) and (3) are the same defect seen from two sides, and both were live:
//! before this, the fingerprint carried `max_conflicts` and `max_decisions` and
//! nothing else from a `SolverConfig` with eighteen fields.
