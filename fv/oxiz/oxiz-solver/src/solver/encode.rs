    /// This is the **single owner** of arithmetic-disequality enforcement.  It
    /// replaced four overlapping syntactic walks — `add_arith_diseq_split`,
    /// `add_arith_trichotomy_clause`, `add_arith_eq_trichotomy` and the never
    /// called `add_arith_diseq_splits_for_sat_model` — which were deleted with
    /// it, not merely demoted.  See the call site in the `TermKind::Eq` arm for
    /// the full rationale; in short:
    ///
    /// * `ArithSolver` has no `assert_neq` and cannot have a useful one — `a
    ///   != b` is not convex, so it has no representation as tableau bounds.
    ///   The standard CDCL(T) answer is to make the case split explicit and
    ///   let the SAT core choose the disjunct, which is exactly this clause.
    /// * Because it is a *tautology* over a total order it is sound in every
    ///   Boolean context, so it can be emitted from the atom itself without
    ///   knowing anything about the polarity the atom will be used under.  It
    ///   adds no constraint; it only ensures that when the core does force
    ///   `(a = b)` false, some strict atom becomes unit and reaches the
    ///   tableau through the ordinary `Constraint::Lt`/`Constraint::Gt` path.
    ///
    /// # Incrementality
    ///
    /// The three clauses go into the SAT core at the current scope, so
    /// `Solver::pop` retracts them with `sat.pop()` like every other clause
    /// this arm emits.  Emission is guarded by
    /// [`Solver::numeric_trichotomy_atoms`], journalled as
    /// [`TrailOp::NumericTrichotomyAdded`], so the mark is dropped by the same
    /// `pop` that drops the clause and the next encode re-emits both together.
    ///
    /// The guard is *required*, not an optimisation.  The Tseitin memo cannot
    /// serve as one: it is retracted per entry on `pop` and deliberately
    /// bypassed when a term is re-encoded under a widened polarity, so this arm
    /// runs again for an atom whose trichotomy is already in the database.
    /// Without the ledger that appended a literal-identical clause over
    /// identical variables — which `oxiz_sat::Solver::add_clause` does not
    /// deduplicate — once per `(push)(pop)` pair, growing without bound.
    /// `scope_rebase_tests::a_no_op_push_pop_between_checks_does_not_re_encode_
    /// the_goal` caught exactly that.
    ///
    /// A ledger *here* is safe in a way one beside the tableau would not be:
    /// it is keyed by term and scoped to the assertion stack, the same stack
    /// `sat.pop()` unwinds.  A lazily-recorded disequality set living next to
    /// the arithmetic solver would instead have to stay in step with the
    /// theory solvers' scope stack, which tracks CDCL *decision levels* rather
    /// than assertion scopes (see `Solver::pop`) — and that mismatch is the
    /// class of bug this whole change exists to remove.
    ///
    /// Skipped when `mk_eq` folds the pair to a constant (syntactically equal
    /// operands): the clause would be trivially satisfied and carry nothing.
