//! Turning a small integer domain into Boolean branches the CDCL core can see.
//!
//! ## The shape of the problem
//!
//! Two theories that share a term have to agree about it, and Nelson-Oppen
//! equality sharing (`theory_manager::nelson_oppen_combine`) is how they do:
//! whenever arithmetic *entails* `t = v`, that equality is handed to EUF. The
//! word "entails" is the catch. Over the integers a term can be confined to a
//! handful of values without any one of them being entailed — `(>= d 0)`
//! together with `(<= d 1)` leaves `d` in `{0, 1}` and entails neither `d = 0`
//! nor `d = 1` — because linear integer arithmetic is not convex.
//!
//! That costs nothing until the same term is an uninterpreted-function
//! argument, at which point *which* of the values it takes decides the answer:
//! `f(0)` and `f(1)` are unrelated as far as congruence closure is concerned.
//! Arithmetic has nothing to propagate, EUF has nothing to refute, and the
//! CDCL(T) core has no atom whose two polarities correspond to the two cases —
//! so it never explores them, and an unsatisfiable formula comes back `sat`.
//!
//! ## What this module does about it
//!
//! It supplies the missing atoms. Once a candidate `sat` exists, every numeric
//! term that (a) is shared with EUF and (b) is confined to a short range by
//! facts the formula asserts unconditionally gets an explicit disjunction
//! `(or (= t lo) … (= t hi))` asserted before the search is run again. Each
//! disjunct is an equality atom both theories see, so the moment CDCL commits
//! to one, congruence closure has something concrete to work with. It is the
//! same effect a hand-written `(assert (or (= d 0) (= d 1)))` would have, and
//! it is the textbook remedy for non-convex theory combination (Barrett et
//! al., *Decision Procedures*, ch. 10; both Z3 and cvc5 do a version of it).
//!
//! ## Why asserting it cannot change the answer
//!
//! The disjunction restates a range the formula's own unconditional facts
//! already impose, so every model of the input satisfies it and no model is
//! lost. "Unconditional" is doing real work in that sentence, and it is why
//! the derivation reads only atoms that are (i) assigned `true` and (ii) at
//! decision level 0: together those mean the formula forced the atom on its
//! own, so it survives every backtrack and holds in every model.
//!
//! Two derivations run over exactly those atoms, and both are used.
//!
//! The **single-atom reading** below ([`Solver::root_level_int_domains`])
//! additionally requires each atom to constrain a *single* term. That is not
//! frugality: reading a bound off one term and transferring it to another
//! through a multi-term fact needs to know what the other terms are, and
//! inside a search that knowledge belongs to the branch being explored rather
//! than to the formula. Baking a branch-local bound into a lemma that outlives
//! the branch is exactly how a satisfiable instance acquires a spurious
//! `unsat`.
//!
//! The **LP relaxation** ([`super::int_range_lp`]) lifts the single-term
//! restriction the only way that stays sound: it asserts *all* the level-0
//! facts simultaneously into a scratch tableau and reads the target term's
//! proved optima off that. Nothing is transferred from a branch, because the
//! tableau contains no branch — only facts that hold in every model — and
//! every approximation it makes (dropped integrality, aliased columns, strict
//! bounds read at their open endpoint) widens the resulting interval rather
//! than narrowing it. See that module for the argument in full. Whichever
//! derivation bounds a side more tightly wins, since both are sound.
//!
//! One further guard is belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing: if the
//! candidate model the core just produced puts a term outside the range
//! derived for it, the derivation and the model disagree and something is
//! wrong with one of them, so the term is skipped instead of split.
//!
//! ## Paying for it
//!
//! A refinement round discards the search and starts over, which is only worth
//! doing when starting over is cheap. The instances a missing case split
//! actually rescues are the ones that answered quickly and wrongly, so the
//! whole refinement is gated on the search so far having stayed inside
//! `check_core::REFINEMENT_WORK_CEILING_PROPAGATIONS` and is allowed
//! [`MAX_REFINEMENT_ROUNDS`] round.
//!
//! That gate used to be a *wall-clock* ceiling of two minutes on the first
//! solve, armed whether or not the caller had set a `:timeout`. It decided
//! verdicts — the unaffordable branch marks its `Sat` unverified — so the
//! verdict was a property of how busy the machine was. Decision (9) of the
//! `#P2b-38` close-out replaced it with a propagation count, which the search
//! advances itself; the calibration that justified 120 s (a `Wisa` QF_UFLIA
//! instance whose first candidate model takes a *minute*, and which answers a
//! wrong `sat` at 258 s with the gate at 5 s and `unsat` at 254 s with the
//! gate raised) is preserved in that constant's own documentation.
