//! Opt-in "decide these first" hint for the embedded SAT engine, built on
//! `oxiz-sat`'s pre-existing [`oxiz_sat::BranchingHeuristic`] extension
//! point (added for `oxiz-ml`; nothing here required touching `oxiz-sat`).
//!
//! # Why this is a config knob, not a default
//!
//! `oxiz-sat`'s `pick_branch_var` builds its candidate list — every
//! unassigned variable, scanned in full — before it ever calls the
//! heuristic's `select`, whenever *any* external heuristic is installed at
//! all (see `oxiz-sat/src/solver/decide.rs`). That scan happens on every
//! single decision, for every solve this `Solver` instance ever runs, once
//! it is wired in — the SAT engine has no cheaper "is there actually a
//! pending hint right now" fast path to skip it with, and `SolverConfig`'s
//! `external_branching` slot can only be set once, at construction (the
//! field is `pub(super)` inside `oxiz-sat`, so a later `set_config` call on
//! this crate's own `Solver` cannot retarget it either — matching the
//! pre-existing behaviour of `restart_strategy` and friends, which also only
//! take effect through `with_config`).
//!
//! A lookup-table-heavy formula's index domains are typically tiny, so this
//! trade is a clear win *for that shape*; an unrelated large formula that
//! never enables it pays nothing, and one that enables it anyway pays the
//! per-decision candidate scan whether or not a table ever shows up. That
//! asymmetry is why `Solver::flatten_lookup_spines` populates the priority
//! list but `enable_domain_first_branching` defaults to `false` — see
//! `SolverConfig`'s doc comment.
