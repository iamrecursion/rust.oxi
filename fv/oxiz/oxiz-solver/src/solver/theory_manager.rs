/// `on_new_level` / `on_backtrack`, but its conflict analysis can (on some
/// formulas) compute a wrong backtrack level and *overwrite* a variable's
/// assignment in place — flipping a decision literal's polarity without ever
/// popping the theory scope that recorded the old polarity.  The incremental
/// EUF / arith / BV solvers only support level-scoped `pop`, not point removal
/// of a single mid-level assertion, so a flipped literal would otherwise leave
/// the theory state permanently reflecting the stale polarity and manufacture a
/// spurious conflict (observed as a wrong top-level UNSAT on satisfiable
/// disjunctive LIA chains).  We therefore shadow every theory-relevant
/// assignment here, keyed so a flip is detected in O(1), and rebuild theory
/// state from the corrected trail when one occurs.

        // assignment (MBQI/array/datatype axiom instances included, since they
        // reach EUF and arith the same way any other assertion does -- through
        // an encoded SAT literal that gets assigned and trailed). The

        // the one they would have seen anyway, so a genuinely `Sat` instance
        // still answers `Sat` with a model the rebuilt state supports.
        //
        // ## Why lazy mode is included too
        //
        // The paragraph above rests entirely on `assignment_trail` being a
        // faithful shadow of the current partial assignment.  This used to hold
        // in eager mode only, so the backstop was gated on it: `on_assignment`
        // returned at its `TheoryMode::Lazy` branch *before* reaching the
        // trail-append arm, leaving `assignment_trail` permanently empty under
        // lazy mode.  Running the backstop there would have reset EUF/arith/BV
        // and replayed *nothing*, discarding every fact the lazy loop had just
        // asserted.
        //
        // Lazy mode now keeps the same shadow trail (see the `TheoryMode::Lazy`
        // branch of `on_assignment`), so the premise holds for both modes and
        // the gate is gone.  The trail is cheap — one `TrailAtom` per assigned
        // theory atom, appended beside the queue entry the lazy path was
        // already pushing — and it is what lazy mode's incremental state needs
        // to be *checkable* rather than merely trusted.
        //
        // Lazy mode was exposed to precisely the hazard this backstop exists
        // for, and the exposure was real, not theoretical: its state is also
        // incremental rather than rebuilt per check, and an arithmetic chain
        // whose entailment has to reach EUF congruence
        // (`x = 2 /\ y = x + 1 /\ f(y) != f(3)`) came back `unknown` — the
        // downstream `model_refutes_assertions` gate correctly refusing a model
        // the incremental state could not justify, rather than the `unsat`
        // eager mode derived from the same formula.
        //
        // ## Why bit-vector problems are excluded
        //
        // `resync_theory_state` calls `bv.reset()` and then replays only the
        // atoms carrying a `var_to_constraint` entry — it never re-mirrors the
        // `bv.assert_bool_value` calls `on_assignment` makes for plain boolean
        // variables, so a BV problem would come back from the rebuild having
        // *lost* the selector values that make a BV-sorted `ite` determinate.
        // That is the same reasoning the in-place-flip path above already
        // applies (see its `self.bv_terms.is_empty()` guard); the backstop
        // takes the identical, conservative gate rather than contradicting it.
        //
        // `bv_terms` lists the bit-vector *variables* of the asserted atoms
        // and is empty for a problem whose only bit-vector terms are opaque
        // leaves — `(distinct (g x) (g y))` — so the gate also asks the
        // bit-blaster itself whether it holds any circuit (`#P2b-29`).  Such
        // a problem carries the argument circuits, the shared leaf
        // equalities and the lemmas the bit-vector / EUF exchange built,
