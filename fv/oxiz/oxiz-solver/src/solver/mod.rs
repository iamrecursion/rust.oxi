    /// their unit consequences at the root.  What must *not* survive is the
    /// third category: assertions that were merely a search-branch decision.

    /// # Why reset-and-replay rather than popping the leaked scopes
    ///
    /// Popping down to the base scope looks more surgical, and it was tried: it
    /// makes the MBQI loop diverge on `tests/mbqi_sat_certification.rs`.  The
    /// reason is that popping addresses only half of the desynchronisation.  The
    /// SAT trail and the theory scope stack must be re-aligned *together*, and
    /// the SAT side is already at the root (`add_clause` calls
    /// `backtrack_to_root` for a unit lemma without notifying the theory layer).
    /// Unwinding the theory scopes alone leaves the next round replaying the
    /// whole trail — decisions included — into what it believes is the base
    /// scope, which commits the *new* branch's facts permanently instead of the
    /// old one's: the same defect, one round later, and now unrecoverable.
    ///
    /// Dropping the trail to the root and re-deriving the theory state from it is
    /// the alignment that actually holds.  `solve_with_theory` restarts with
    /// `theory_processed == 0` and replays the entire trail through
    /// `TheoryManager::on_assignment`, so the three solvers are repopulated —
    /// through the ordinary assert path, re-interning terms and re-registering
    /// theory variables as they go — from exactly the constraints that are active
    /// now.  Nothing is re-encoded, so the clause database and the
    /// [`Self::encoded_terms`] memo are untouched and the clause count plateaus
    /// across rounds (`scope_rebase_tests::clause_count_plateaus_across_rounds`).
    ///
    /// This is the same reset-and-replay strategy the array-axiom refinement
    /// rounds and [`TheoryManager::resync_theory_state`] already rely on; the
    /// solvers support only level-scoped `pop`, never point removal of a single
    /// mid-scope assertion, so it is also the only available way to retract a
    /// fact that a leaked scope has put out of reach.
    ///
    /// # The one seam for theory-state teardown
    ///
    /// Four sites need the theory solvers returned to a state that reflects only
    /// what is currently asserted, and all four call this function: `check`'s
    /// entry, the array-axiom refinement boundary, the MBQI round boundary, and
    /// [`Self::pop`].  They are deliberately *not* allowed to hand-roll the set
    /// — see the comment in `pop`, where an open-coded copy of it drifted (it
    /// omitted `bv.reset()`).  [`Self::reset`] is the one exception: it performs
    /// a strictly larger teardown that also drops the quantifier engines, the
    /// term/variable tables and every side cache, so it does not reduce to this.
    ///
    /// # Invariant: theory-variable registrations are re-derived, never carried
    ///
    /// The encoder registers theory variables directly into these long-lived
    /// solvers as it internalises a term — `Solver::register_arith_atom` calls
    /// `ArithSolver::intern`, the `Var` arm of `encode_depth` calls it and
    /// `BvSolver::new_bv`.  Those registrations are wiped by the resets here, so
    /// the invariant this function relies on is:
    ///
    /// > every theory-variable registration a later round needs is re-performed
    /// > by the trail replay, not inherited from before the rebase.
    ///
    /// It holds because the theory solvers are told about a term only through
    /// an assertion, and every assertion path re-registers what it mentions:
    /// `ArithSolver::assert_{eq,le,ge,lt,gt}` call `intern` on each term of the
    /// linear expression they are given, `TheoryManager::process_constraint`
    /// re-interns EUF nodes through `intern_term_for_congruence` (plus
    /// `intern_arith_shared_terms` for the arithmetic operands), and
    /// `bit_blast_bv_pair` re-blasts both operands — falling back to
    /// `BvSolver::new_bv` for a leaf — before every BV check.  The replay runs
    /// `on_assignment` over the *whole* trail, so each of those paths is taken
    /// again for every atom that is still asserted.

    /// The encoder-side memos (`Solver::arith_terms`, `Solver::bv_terms`,
