//! Regression tests for [`super::skolem_candidates`]'s Skolem-candidate walk.
//!
//! Covers two changes to `collect_skolem_candidates_rec`:
//!
//! 1. The conversion from native recursion to an explicit worklist (so a
//!    pathologically deep term hits a graceful, bounded-native-stack loop
//!    instead of a fatal stack overflow no `Result` can report).
//! 2. Making the walk's `match` **exhaustive over every `TermKind`**, with no
//!    `_` catch-all. Before this change the walk covered only `Apply`,
//!    `Forall`/`Exists`, `And`/`Or`, `Not`/`Neg`,
//!    `Implies`/`Eq`/`Lt`/`Le`/`Gt`/`Ge`/`Sub`/`Div`/`Mod`, `Add`/`Mul`,
//!    `Ite`, and `Select`/`Store`; every BitVector operation, every
//!    FloatingPoint operation, every String operation, `Distinct`, `Let`,
//!    `Match`, `Xor`, and the datatype constructor/tester/selector forms fell
//!    into a `_ => {}` catch-all and were silently never descended into. A
//!    Skolem application nested under any of those was therefore never found
//!    as an MBQI candidate.
//!
//! Split out as a child module of `encode` (rather than appended inline) so
//! that `encode.rs` -- already close to the workspace's 2000-line-per-file
//! ceiling -- does not have to absorb the new test bulk; see
//! `euf/solver/tests.rs` for the identical precedent (file `X.rs` + child
//! module `X/tests.rs`).
//!
//! Two different inspection mechanisms are used below, deliberately:
//!
//! * The `visited: FxHashSet<TermId>` set the caller threads through records
//!   exactly which terms the walk reached, independent of whether any of
//!   them looked like a Skolem application. This is what the *preservation*
//!   tests use, since they are about the shape of the traversal itself.
//! * `MBQIIntegration::extra_candidates_snapshot` (a `#[cfg(test)]`-gated
//!   accessor added alongside this change, since `extra_candidates` is
//!   private to a different module tree -- `mbqi::integration` -- that
//!   plain module-descendant visibility does not reach) reports the actual
//!   MBQI candidate pool `self.mbqi.add_candidate` populated. This is what
//!   the *newly covered family* tests use below, since they are about the
//!   real, end-to-end, observable behaviour change: does a Skolem
//!   application under a bitvector/floating-point/string/etc. operation
//!   actually reach the candidate pool now.
