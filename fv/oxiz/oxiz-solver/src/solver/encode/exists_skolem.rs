//! Skolemization of the existentials an assertion states *unconditionally*.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `(assert (exists ((y Int)) φ(y)))` says "some `y` satisfies `φ`".  Left as a
//! quantifier it reaches MBQI, which can only *guess* a witness: it instantiates
//! `y` with candidate ground terms and adds `φ(c)` to the SAT core as a hard
//! unit clause.  Every such guess is a strengthening — sound for `sat` (a model
//! of `φ(c)` is a model of `∃y. φ(y)`) but hopeless for completeness, because a
//! witness outside the candidate pool is never tried, and outright dangerous
//! when several guesses for the *same* existential are asserted together (their
//! conjunction can be unsatisfiable while the existential is not).
//!
//! Skolemization replaces the guess with a *symbol*: `∃y. φ(y)` becomes
//! `φ(sk)` for a fresh constant `sk`.  This is the textbook equisatisfiability
//! rewrite — any model of `φ(sk)` yields a model of `∃y. φ(y)` by forgetting
//! `sk`, and any model of `∃y. φ(y)` extends to one of `φ(sk)` by interpreting
//! `sk` as the witness — so the ordinary ground solver now *searches* for the
//! witness instead of guessing it, and the assertion carries no quantifier at
//! all when `φ` is quantifier-free.
//!
//! # Where the rewrite is legal
//!
//! Only at **positive polarity on the asserted spine**.  `(assert (not (exists
//! ((y Int)) φ)))` is `∀y. ¬φ`, whose Skolemization would be a *weakening*, and
//! an existential under a disjunction / implication / `ite` branch is not
//! asserted at all.  This module therefore rewrites exactly the conjuncts of
//! the assertion's top-level `And` spine: a conjunct of an unconditionally
//! asserted conjunction is itself unconditionally asserted, at positive
//! polarity, and rebuilding the conjunction replaces that one occurrence
//! without touching any other position the same sub-term may appear in.
//!
//! An existential nested deeper (inside a `forall` body) keeps its usual path:
//! [`Solver::register_asserted_forall`](super::super::Solver) Skolemizes
//! `∀x. ∃y. φ` into `∀x. φ(x, sk(x))` for MBQI.
//!
//! Reference: Z3's `ast/normal_forms/nnf.cpp` / `qe` Skolemization of asserted
//! existentials.
