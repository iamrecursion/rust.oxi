                //   `Forall`, `Exists`, `DtConstructor`, `DtTester`, and the
                //   string and floating-point operations are *not* leaves, yet
                //   are not descended into either.  This mirrors
                //   `Solver::extract_linear_terms`, which treats exactly the
                //   same set as non-linear: a comparison whose operand is one of
                //   these fails the linear parse, so no arithmetic constraint is
                //   built from it and the `encode_guards` honesty gate is what
                //   reports the resulting incompleteness (`Unknown`) rather than
                //   a model.  Registering theory variables underneath such an
                //   operand would therefore not make any atom decidable — the
                //   parse would still fail — so the walk stops here.  The
                //   Boolean structure of `Xor`/`Implies`/`Distinct`/`Let` is
                //   reached anyway, by `Solver::encode_depth`'s own descent,
                //   which calls this walk again on each theory atom it finds
                //   inside them; and quantifier bodies are handled by the MBQI
                //   and E-matching registration passes, not here (a bound
                //   variable has no ground model value to extract).
                //   `oxiz-solver/src/solver/encode/track_theory_vars/tests.rs`
                //   pins this set, so widening it is a deliberate, tested
                //   decision rather than an accident.
