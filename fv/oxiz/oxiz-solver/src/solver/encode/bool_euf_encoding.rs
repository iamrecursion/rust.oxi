//! Bool/EUF encoding pre-passes that give congruence closure the facts it
//! needs to see through a non-Bool `ite` or a compound Bool argument.
//!
//! Split out of `encode.rs` into this child module, following the same
//! `encode/` convention as `track_theory_vars.rs`/`skolem_candidates.rs`.
//!
//! # Why these live here and not inside the generic Tseitin encoder
//!
//! Both passes work by hoisting a subterm out to a *fresh, globally scoped*
//! variable plus a defining side-condition, then conjoining the
//! side-condition onto the term being rewritten. That is only sound when the
//! whole rewritten conjunction is asserted as a hard, top-level fact: the
//! fresh variable's defining equation must hold in *every* model, not only
//! in the branch of a larger formula where the rewritten subterm happens to
//! be used positively. Folding the rewrite into [`Solver::encode_depth`]
//! instead -- which is polarity-sensitive and reused for sub-expressions
//! nested under `Not`/`Or`/an implication's antecedent -- would let the SAT
//! search satisfy the *negative* occurrence of the rewritten term by
//! assigning the fresh variable an incorrect value instead of by making the
//! real fact false, since a Tseitin `AND` gate's defining clauses only
//! constrain its conjuncts when the gate is forced *true*. So both passes
//! run exactly once, over the whole assertion, before any encoding starts
//! (see [`Solver::assert`]/[`Solver::assert_named`]), and the result is
//! asserted as a single top-level clause.
//!
//! [`Solver::encode_nonbool_ite_equality`] (below) is the
//! complementary *narrow* mechanism: a one-directional `eq_var -> branch
//! consequence` clause added from inside the generic recursive encoder. It
//! does not introduce a fresh variable and only reinforces an
//! already-determined `eq_var`, so it is safe under any polarity and also
//! covers the paths that never go through `Solver::assert` at all -- MBQI
//! instantiation and the axiom passes call [`Solver::encode`] directly on
//! ground lemmas.

/// since `arith_axioms.rs` already axiomatises these) `Int`/`Real`.
///
/// `BitVec`, `String` and `FloatingPoint` sorts each have their own
/// theory-specific encoder that recurses through `ite` directly as part of
/// bit-blasting / ground solving -- and, critically, some bit-vector operators
/// (`bvsmod`, `bvcomp`, the rotates, `zero_extend`/`sign_extend`) are
/// *desugared into a `BitVec`-sorted `ite`* by the term builder itself, so a
/// real assertion can easily contain one without the user ever writing `ite`.
/// Replacing that `ite` with a fresh opaque variable before the bit-blaster
/// ever sees it deletes the very structure the blaster recurses on: this was
/// caught by
/// `test_bvsmod_symbolic_divisor_operand_unsat`/`test_bvsmod_controls_stay_sat`
/// going from correct to a false `sat` (the model no longer matched the
/// operation's reference semantics) the first time this pass ran

///
/// # Why `Array` is *not* in that list (`#P2b-41`)
///
/// It used to be, on the same "the theory's own encoder recurses through it"
/// grounds -- and for arrays that was simply false. `array_axioms.rs` notes an
/// `ite`'s branches as *foreign* array terms and stops there: no rule ever
/// relates `select(ite(c,a,b), i)` to `select(a,i)` or `select(b,i)`, so a
/// read through an array-sorted `ite` was a free bit-vector. Seven lines were
/// enough for a wrong `sat`:
///
/// ```smt2
/// (declare-const a0 (Array (_ BitVec 1) (_ BitVec 1)))
/// (declare-const a1 (Array (_ BitVec 1) (_ BitVec 1)))
/// (declare-const p Bool)
/// (assert (= (select (ite p a0 a1) #b0) #b1))
/// (assert (= (select a0 #b0) #b0))
/// (assert (= (select a1 #b0) #b0))
/// ```
///
/// The read is `a0[0]` or `a1[0]`, both pinned to `#b0`, so the script is
/// unsatisfiable; it answered `sat` in 0.5 ms on this tree, on the 0.3.4 base
/// and on crates.io 0.3.3 alike, and the model it printed falsified its own
/// assertion. The same hole was the second-largest family of falsifying models
/// in an independent 2,350-script campaign (48 of 114).
///
/// Naming the `ite` with a fresh array variable `v` plus `c => v = then` /
/// `!c => v = else` closes both halves at once, and it is the *only* fix that
/// closes the model half: read-side lemmas would refute the wrong `sat` but

///
/// That is fixed at the source — the parser now returns the substituted body
/// directly and emits no `Let` at all (see `close_frame` in
/// `oxiz-core/src/smtlib/parser/terms.rs`) — deliberately *not* by making this

/// `Let` keeps its place beside `Forall`/`Exists` below, and a `Let` reaching
/// here (only possible from a programmatic `TermManager::mk_let`, where the
/// body may really have free occurrences of the bound name) is correctly left
/// alone.
///
/// Arithmetic disequalities no longer depend on any such walk at all: the
