//! Ground evaluation of integer expressions modulo the array read-over-write
//! axiom, for the array/arithmetic ordering check.
//!
//! # Failure direction
//!
//! Unlike its bit-vector sibling, "not evaluable" here is *incompleteness* and
//! not unsoundness, because an Int-sorted `select` is a first-class arithmetic
//! variable rather than an opaque leaf: `encode` registers it in `arith_terms`
//! and parses `(< (select a i) 5)` as a linear atom, so when this check declines
//! an assertion two backstops still reach a sound verdict — the alias-aware
//! read-over-write lemmas in `array_axioms.rs`, whose Int-sorted equalities do
//! enter the tableau, and `propagate_euf_equalities_to_arith`, which carries
//! congruence-derived equalities between arith-registered terms across with an
//! explanation.
//!
//! That is a structural argument about the shapes reachable today, not a gate
//! that says "an ordering check was skipped, so answer `Unknown`".  It is
//! therefore worth keeping the coverage here honest rather than relying on it.
//!
//! # Semantics that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! * `div` and `mod` are **Euclidean** on integers: the unique `q` with
//!   `a = b*q + r` and `0 <= r < |b|`, so `(div -7 2) = -4` and `(mod -7 2) = 1`
//!   — not Rust's `/` and `%`, which truncate towards zero.  They go through
//!   [`CheckedEuclid`], matching `oxiz_core`'s `rewrite::arith` and its model
//!   evaluator, which both use `checked_div_euclid`.
//! * Division and modulo **by zero are uninterpreted**, not total.  SMT-LIB
//!   leaves `(div a 0)` a fixed but unspecified value, so folding it to anything
//!   at all would claim a fact the theory does not state — and this evaluator's
//!   answer feeds a check that reports `Unsat`, so a fabricated value could
//!   refute a satisfiable formula.  [`CheckedEuclid`] returns `None` at a zero
//!   divisor, which is exactly the required answer.  (This is the opposite of the
//!   bit-vector division family, where SMT-LIB *does* specify a total result.)
//! * `Div` and `Mod` are folded only for an **Int-sorted** node.  The same
//!   `TermKind` means exact rational division when the operands are Real, and
//!   Euclidean folding would be wrong for it.
//!
//! # Why the walk is iterative
//!
//! It folds the two sides of every `<`/`<=`/`>`/`>=` assertion, so its depth is
//! input-controlled, and it runs on whatever stack `check_sat`'s caller has.
//! With `opt-level = 0` the recursive version's frame measured about 1 KiB, so a
//! 1 MiB worker overflowed at roughly 1 000 levels.
//!
//! This evaluator had a **second**, worse depth source, and it is the reason the
//! conversion mattered more here than the structural nesting did.  The `Select`
//! arm does not descend into a sub-term: it *rewrites* the read through the
//! read-over-write axiom and re-dispatches on the result, which may be an
//! entirely unrelated term reached through the array-variable alias map.  Two
//! consequences:
//!
//! * The chain length is bounded by the number of alias *assertions*, not by any
//!   term's depth, so
//!   [`Solver::term_exceeds_encode_depth`](super::Solver::term_exceeds_encode_depth)
//!   — which bounds structural depth at
//!   [`ENCODE_DEPTH_LIMIT`](crate::solver::ENCODE_DEPTH_LIMIT) before `check`
//!   reaches the array checks — does not bound it at all.  Each link
//!   `(= b_k (store a 0 (select b_(k-1) 0)))` nests only four deep.  Two thousand
//!   such assertions aborted the process with the depth gate reporting nothing
//!   wrong.
//! * The chain can **cycle**.  `(= b (store a 0 (select b 0)))` rewrites
//!   `(select b 0)` to itself, and the recursive version followed that rewrite
//!   forever — as an infinite loop wherever the tail call was optimised into one,
//!   and as a stack overflow where it was not.  Either way `check` never
//!   returned, on two well-sorted assertions.  [`Solver::open_number`] carries
//!   the set of reads it has already rewritten along the current chain and
//!   answers "not evaluable" on a repeat.
//!
//! The frame/cursor shape is the one `model_eval.rs` and `check_fp.rs` use; see
//! `eval_bv.rs` for the shared description, including why the walk is
//! *heterogeneous* (an `ite` condition produces a truth value, everything else a
//! number) and why [`Step::Tail`] is what makes `ite` visit only the taken
//! branch.  There is deliberately no memo table.
