//! `define-fun-rec` / `define-funs-rec`: registry plus the fuel-bounded
//! unfolding driver that discharges the definitional axiom.
//!
//! # What a recursive definition means here
//!
//! `(define-fun-rec f ((x S)) R body)` asserts the axiom
//! `forall x. f(x) = body`. Nothing else constrains `f`: the parser
//! deliberately registers it as an ordinary declared symbol so that call sites
//! build real `Apply` nodes, and it never expands the body at those call sites
//! (expansion would not terminate). Discharging the axiom is this module's job.
//!
//! # The verdict contract (read this before changing anything below)
//!
//! The driver instantiates the axiom at finitely many argument tuples and hands
//! the instances to the ordinary solver. Instances are *consequences* of the
//! axiom, so the instantiated problem is a **relaxation** of the real one:
//!
//! * **`unsat` is returned immediately and is final.** A refutation that uses
//!   only consequences of the axiom refutes the original problem too.
//! * **`sat` is returned only with a certificate.** The relaxation can be
//!   satisfiable when the real problem is not (the solver is free to invent a
//!   value for an `f`-application whose defining instance was never
//!   instantiated), so a bare `sat` is never published. Two certificates are
//!   accepted:
//!   - **C1, saturation** — the unfolding closed: every `f`-application
//!     reachable from the assertions got its instance, so no application the
//!     assertions can talk about is left free.
//!
//!     Note precisely what this does *not* say. The axiom quantifies over all
//!     arguments, and closure only covers the reachable ones, so a definition
//!     that is unsatisfiable at some *unreachable* argument is not caught:
//!     `f(n) = ite(n = 0, 0, f(n) + 1)` with only `(= (f 0) 0)` asserted
//!     saturates at `f(0) = 0` and is reported `sat`, even though the axiom has
//!     no model at any `n /= 0`. Z3 4.15.4 answers `sat` here too — this is the
//!     shared reading of `define-fun-rec` as a definition constraining the
//!     applications a problem actually makes, not a standalone theory.
//!   - **C2, model re-computation** — a ground evaluator recomputes every
//!     recursive application occurring in the user's assertions directly from
//!     the definitions and finds that the model already agrees with it (see
//!     [`eval`]).
//! * **Everything else is `unknown`, and it is reached in finite time.** Both
//!   budgets are finite — the fuel schedule bounds the number of instances per
//!   round and the number of rounds, and the certifier's evaluation budget
//!   bounds the re-computation — so a definition that does not terminate is
//!   answered `unknown`, **never** by hanging. An *inconsistent* definition
//!   such as `f(x) = f(x) + 1` is still correctly `unsat`, because its single
//!   instance is already contradictory.
//!
//! The one thing that must never happen is a bare `sat`/`unsat` derived from a
//! problem where the definition was dropped: that silently answers a strictly
//! weaker question.
//!
//! # Where the instances live
//!
//! Instances are asserted **directly on the solver**, inside a scratch scope,
//! and never into `Context::assertions` — `(get-assertions)` must keep
//! reporting exactly the script's own assertions, byte for byte. The scratch
//! scope is deliberately left *open* on an accepted verdict so `(get-model)` /
//! `(get-value ..)` read the model that the instances helped build; it is
//! discharged by [`Context::invalidate_last_check`] (which every
//! `assert`/`push`/`pop` calls before touching the solver's scope stack) and at
//! the top of the driver itself.
