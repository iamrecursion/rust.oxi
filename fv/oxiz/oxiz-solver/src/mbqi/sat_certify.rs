//! Sound MBQI SAT certification for the (almost-)uninterpreted / bounded
//! fragment, via complete instantiation (Ge & de Moura, CAV 2009).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The counterexample-guided core of MBQI ([`super::counterexample`]) can
//! *refute* a quantified goal by finding an instantiation that the candidate
//! model falsifies, but on its own it never *certifies* satisfiability: for a
//! bound variable ranging over an infinite domain (Int, Real, ...) a finite
//! sample of "no counterexample found" proves nothing.  This module supplies
//! the missing certification step.
//!
//! # The idea: complete instantiation + ground saturation
//!
//! For the fragments the SMT-LIB logics UFLIA / UFLRA / AUFLIA target, a
//! universal `∀x⃗. φ` has a *finite, complete* instantiation set: instantiating
//! every bound variable over that set yields a ground formula that is
//! equisatisfiable with the original.  This module computes that complete set
//! and hands it to the ordinary ground solver as lemmas.  Certification is then
//! a saturation test performed by the caller: once **every** complete instance
//! has been emitted and the ground solver *still* reports a model, that model
//! satisfies the whole formula and `sat` is sound.
//!
//! Crucially, the `sat` conclusion rests on the ground solver's own SAT result
//! over the real assertions — never on evaluating the body under the completed
//! model (which may be an incomplete or macro-completed approximation).  A
//! universal instance is always a sound logical consequence, so adding the
//! complete set can only make an unsatisfiable problem reveal its conflict; it
//! can never turn `unsat` into `sat`.
//!
//! # The complete instantiation set
//!
//! * **Bounded box** — body `guard ⇒ C` where `guard` pins every Int variable
//!   to a concrete finite interval `[l, u]`.  The whole interval is enumerated:
//!   outside it the guard is false (implication vacuously true), inside every
//!   value is instantiated.  Exhaustive, hence trivially complete.
//!
//! * **Essentially uninterpreted** — every occurrence of every bound variable
//!   is a direct argument of an uninterpreted function or array `select`.  Each
//!   variable is instantiated over the ground terms already appearing at that
//!   argument position (harvested from the completed model's interpretation
//!   graph).  This is exactly Ge & de Moura's relevant set.
//!
//! * **Almost uninterpreted (guarded)** — body `guard ⇒ C` where the consequent
//!   `C` reads every bound variable *only* through uninterpreted functions /
//!   array operations (strictly essentially uninterpreted), and `guard` is a
//!   conjunction of:
//!     - **variable-vs-ground** comparisons `x ⊕ t` (`⊕ ∈ {≤,<,≥,>,=}`, `t`
//!       ground), including the disequality `¬(x = t)`.  The ground bound `t` is
//!       folded into the relevant instantiation set (see
//!       [`augment_guard_grounds`]) so no region boundary is missed;
//!     - **variable-vs-variable** comparisons `x ⊕ y` for the monotone-preserving
//!       relations `≤`, `≥`, `=` only.
//!       Strict `<` / `>` *between two variables*, and any bare variable in the
//!       consequent, are excluded because they are not preserved by the
//!       model-extension projection.  Each variable is instantiated over its sort's
//!       relevant set (UF-argument terms ∪ guard-ground constants); outside the guard
//!       region the implication is vacuously true.
//!
//! When *any* tracked quantifier falls outside these fragments (or is an
//! existential, which needs a witness rather than an instance) the module
//! reports [`CertifyResult::NotEligible`] and the caller keeps its normal
//! behaviour, ultimately answering `unknown`.  The module never fabricates
//! `sat`.
