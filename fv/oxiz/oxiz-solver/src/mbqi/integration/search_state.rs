//! The line between a *search* and the *goal* it searches, for
//! [`MBQIIntegration`].
//!
//! One `Solver::check` is one MBQI search.  Everything that search derives —
//! the ground terms it harvested from its own instantiations, the dedup filter
//! that stops a round re-deriving an earlier round's work, the one-shot
//! blind-instantiation guard, the round counter and its budget — belongs to
//! *that* search and must not be visible to the next one.  Everything the
//! caller put there — the registered quantifiers, the candidates from
//! `declare-const`, the configured limits, the cumulative statistics — belongs
//! to the goal and must survive.
//!
//! Getting that line wrong is task #28's third mechanism, and it goes wrong in
//! both directions at once: search residue left behind makes the next check on
//! an unchanged goal reach *further* (new terms, new SAT variables, new
//! original clauses, appearing several `check-sat` calls in), while the
//! accumulated round counter eventually crosses `max_rounds` and makes it reach
//! *nothing at all*.
//!
//! This module is that line, written down once:
//! [`MBQIIntegration::search_checkpoint`] takes the restore point and
//! [`MBQIIntegration::restore_search_state`] applies it.
