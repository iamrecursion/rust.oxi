//! Fuzz target for the parser-to-solver end-to-end path
//!
//! Parses arbitrary bytes as an SMT-LIB2 script and feeds the resulting
//! commands into the solver, exercising the same soundness oracles as
//! `fuzz_solver`'s structured-command fuzzing (see that target's module
//! docs for the full rationale). This target complements `fuzz_solver` by
//! driving the solver exclusively through `parse_script`, so parser bugs
//! that only manifest once their output reaches the solver (malformed
//! terms, wrong sorts, etc.) are exercised directly instead of only via
//! the structured `SmtCommand` generator.
//!
//! # Soundness oracles
//!
//! Discarding `check()`'s result only lets libFuzzer catch panics/crashes:
//! it can never find a *wrong* sat/unsat answer. This target therefore
//! keeps track of every assertion it feeds the solver and, whenever the
//! solver reports `Sat`, evaluates the returned model against those
//! assertions (`assert_model_satisfies`). A model that does not satisfy
//! the formula it was built from is a genuine soundness bug, not a mere
//! crash. `check()` is also required to be idempotent (repeating it with
//! no intervening mutation must reproduce the same verdict), and an empty
//! assertion set is known-satisfiable by construction, so `Unsat` on zero
//! assertions is always a bug.
