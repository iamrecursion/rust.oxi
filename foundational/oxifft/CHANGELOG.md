### Fixed (x86_64 wrong-answer SIMD bug)

- **🔴 x86_64 produced wrong FFT results on every CPU without AVX2 — fixed.**
  Discovered 2026-08-03 by running the suite on x86_64 for the first time
  (there is no CI and the primary development host is aarch64):
  `cargo nextest run -p oxifft --all-features --target x86_64-apple-darwin`
  (via Rosetta 2, which exposes SSE4.2 and no AVX) failed **93 of 1447**
  tests with errors of magnitude ~10-100 against a 1e-10 tolerance —
  a wrong-answer bug, not a precision one — cascading through `chirp_z`,
  `conv`, `dft::codelets::{notw,simd}`,
  `dft::solvers::{bluestein,cache_oblivious,rader,simd_butterfly}`,
  `rdft::solvers::r2r`, `signal::{hilbert,resample}`, `sparse`, and the
  size-coverage/rustfft-comparison sweeps: everything that bottoms out in the
  shared SIMD butterfly engine.

  Two independent defects in `dft::solvers::simd_butterfly`'s SSE3 kernel
  (`dit_butterflies_sse3`, the tier every non-AVX2 x86_64 CPU takes, and the
  one `dft/codelets/simd/large_sizes.rs`'s `dit_{64,128,256}_precomputed`
  delegate to on every non-aarch64 target):

  1. **Wrong complex-multiply lane order.** The twiddle product shuffled its
     second partial product into `[v_im*cos, v_im*sin]` before
     `_mm_addsub_pd`, computing `[v_re*cos - v_im*cos, v_re*sin + v_im*sin]`
     instead of `[v_re*cos - v_im*sin, v_re*sin + v_im*cos]`. The two agree
     only where `cos == sin` (45 degrees), which is why the smallest radix-2
     stages masked it. The shuffle is removed — `addsub`'s operand was
     already in the right lane order.
  2. **Twiddle recurrence drift.** The kernel advanced twiddles with
     `w *= w_step` per butterfly, accumulating roughly `half_m * EPSILON` of
     error per stage. Invisible against a 1e-10 scalar comparison, it pushed
     Bluestein's chirp round-trip (two chained padded power-of-two
     transforms) past its 1e-13 relative-error gate at n=257/509/1009. The
     kernel now reads the shared `PrecomputedTwiddles` table, exactly as the
     AVX2 and NEON kernels already did.

  Result: **x86_64 is now 1455/1455 passing** (`--all-features`,
  `--target x86_64-apple-darwin`), and aarch64 is green at 1765/1765. Pinned by a new
  `test_simd_butterfly_matches_naive_dft` that checks the dispatched kernel
  against a directly evaluated DFT at n=8/16/64/256 in both directions — an
  absolute-accuracy gate, unlike the pre-existing tests which only compared
  the SIMD path against the equally-drifting scalar recurrence.

  **Scope caveat, stated plainly:** Rosetta 2 reports SSE4.2 and no AVX
  (`arch -x86_64 sysctl machdep.cpu.features`), so what the x86_64 run
  exercises is the **SSE2/SSE3 tier only**. Every AVX / AVX2 / AVX-512 code
  path in the crate — `simd/avx.rs`, `simd/avx2.rs`, `simd/avx512.rs`,
  `dft/codelets/hand_avx512.rs`, `dft/solvers/simd_butterfly.rs`'s
  `dit_butterflies_avx2`, `dft/solvers/stockham/x86_64.rs`,
  `dft/solvers/generic.rs`, `dft/codelets/simd/large_sizes.rs` and
  `kernel/complex_mul.rs` — **has still never been executed on any host**,
  because no AVX2-capable machine is available to this project. Exactly one
  function out of that set, `dit_butterflies_avx2` (the tier a real post-2013
  desktop or server would take for this transform), was **hand-audited** as
  part of this fix: every `_mm256_set_pd`/`_mm256_permute_pd` lane order,
  every `_mm256_blend_pd` immediate, the radix-4 stage pairing and the fused
  `W_8`/`W_16` constants check out, and it already read the precomputed
  table. Do not read "x86_64 fixed" as "the AVX tier is verified".

### Fixed

- **Precomputed-twiddle-table overrun turned into a scalar fallback.**
  `dit_butterflies_f64` is `pub`; for `n > 65536` both the x86_64 and aarch64
  SIMD kernels indexed `PrecomputedTwiddles::offsets` (16 entries) out of
  range and panicked. Such lengths now take the scalar path, which derives
  twiddles on the fly. Internal callers cap at 4096, so this was reachable
  only through the public entry point.

### Added

- **`oxifft-adapter-mpi`: `MpiFlags::transposed_in` is implemented** across every
  slab plan family — `MpiPlan2D`, `MpiPlan3D`, `MpiPlanND`, and (where the flag
  is meaningful) `MpiRealPlan2D::c2r` / `MpiRealPlan3D::c2r`. It previously
  returned a "not yet implemented" `MpiError::FftError` from all four
  constructors, so the standard FFTW-MPI idiom — a `transposed_out` forward
  followed by a `transposed_in` inverse, which avoids one full `alltoallv` per
  round trip — could not be expressed at all. With the flag set, each plan
  mirrors its pipeline: the axis that is complete on the local rank in the
  transposed distribution is transformed *first*, and a single distributed
  transpose then restores the slab for the remaining axes. Verified with real
  `mpirun` runs at 1, 2, 3 and 4 ranks against the same serial references the
  natural-layout scenarios use, including non-divisible dimensions and the
  `size > n0` degenerate case (`examples/mpi_integration.rs`).
- **`MpiPlanND` now honours `transposed_out`** as well. It accepted the flag and
  silently emitted natural-layout output, which is the same silent-wrong-result
  shape the `transposed_in` rejection was there to avoid.
- **`MpiRealPlan{2,3}D::r2c` reject `transposed_in` with an explanatory typed
  error** rather than a "not yet implemented" one: an r2c plan's input is the
  real-space slab, which has no transposed layout. This mirrors FFTW-MPI, which
  pairs `FFTW_MPI_TRANSPOSED_OUT` on r2c with `FFTW_MPI_TRANSPOSED_IN` on c2r.
- **`MpiPlan2D`/`3D`/`ND::local_footprints()`**: the `(input, output)` local
  element counts for the plan's flag combination, so callers can size a single
  in-place buffer correctly when the two sides differ.
- **The WebAssembly `simd128` backend is now reachable.** `WasmSimdF64` /
  `WasmSimdF32` were fully implemented and publicly re-exported but no transform
  path ever constructed one, so a `simd128` build did exactly the same scalar
  work as a plain one. New `dft::codelets::simd::wasm_backend` provides size-2,
  size-4 and size-8 codelets for both precisions, and `notw_2_dispatch` /
  `notw_4_dispatch` / `notw_8_dispatch` route into them on `wasm32` with
  `target_feature = "simd128"`. The codelets are written against the
  `SimdVector`/`SimdComplex` traits, so the identical source compiles against the
  backend's scalar stand-in on the development host, where six new tests check it
  against a directly evaluated DFT in both directions. **Not verified at run
  time on WASM:** no WASM runtime is available to this project, so the `v128`
  instruction sequences inside the trait impls remain unexecuted.

### Security

- **`api::parallel::RawPtr` no longer round-trips pointers through `usize`.**
  Found by the first MIRI run over the crate's portable unsafe surface, which
  flagged every `RawPtr` accessor with `warning: integer-to-pointer cast`. The
  `ptr as usize` / `usize as *mut T` round trip strips the pointer's provenance,
  so the derived `add`/`from_raw_parts` accesses in `ParallelPlan2D`/`3D`/`ND`
  were no longer provably in-bounds of the buffer they came from under
  Stacked/Tree Borrows. `RawPtr` now carries `*mut u8` and casts
  pointer-to-pointer. Miri is clean over `api::parallel`, `api::memory`,
  `api::plan`, `kernel::complex_mul`, `dft::problem` and `dft::plan` (98 tests)
  afterwards; see TODO.md's Quality Gates for what stays out of Miri's reach.

- **`dispatch_hand_avx512_size{16,32,64}_{f32,f64}` now reject wrong-length
  slices.** These six `pub` functions (and the `notw_16/32/64_dispatch`
  wrappers that forward to them) handed any-length safe slices to raw-pointer
  AVX-512 codelets that unconditionally read/wrote exactly N elements; a
  shorter slice was an out-of-bounds access reachable with no `unsafe` block
  in the caller. Each entry point now `assert_eq!`s the slice length first.
- **`DftProblem::sz` / `vecsz` are no longer public fields.** They are
  `pub(crate)` with read-only `sz()` / `vecsz()` accessors, and a new private
  `buffer_len` (captured once, at construction, by the `unsafe` constructor)
  is what bounds every raw-pointer access in `Problem::zero` and
  `DftPlan::solve`. Previously, safe code holding a legitimately constructed
  `DftProblem` could enlarge `sz` after the fact and drive both methods past
  the buffer the `unsafe` constructor was actually promised.
- **`ThreadPool::parallel_for` now documents the "call `f` exactly once per
  index in `0..count`" invariant** that `api::parallel`'s raw-pointer row/
  column/fiber partitioning has always relied on for soundness, and
  `api::parallel` no longer *trusts* it: a new `IndexClaims` one-shot claim
  table makes every partitioning site tolerate a pool that calls the closure
  out of range or more than once, degrading to incomplete results instead of
  out-of-bounds writes or aliased `&mut` access.
- **`api::parallel`'s `n0 * n1` / `dims.iter().product()` extent
  computations are now overflow-checked** (`checked_extent` /
  `checked_dims_product`), so a wrapped product can no longer pass the
  buffer-length `assert_eq!` and then be used unwrapped for raw-pointer
  indexing; `ParallelPlan2D`/`3D`/`ND::new` reject overflowing extents by
  returning `None`, and the free `*_parallel` functions panic with a named
  message instead of wrapping silently.
- **`algorithm_from_solver_name` now re-validates every solver-name arm
  against the transform size `n`, not just half of them.** Wisdom is
  attacker-influenceable input (importable from a string, a file, or the
  system wisdom paths), and an entry is only `(size, name, cost)`. A planted
  `(1024 "nop" 1.0)` line used to reconstruct `Algorithm::Nop`, after which
  `execute_inplace` silently returned the caller's input unchanged as an
  "FFT result" (`execute` panicked instead); a planted `(6 "ct-dit" 1.0)`
  drove the radix-2 engine at a non-power-of-two size past its
  `debug_assert!`-only guard. `"nop"`, `"direct"`, `"ct-dit"`, `"ct-dif"`,
  `"ct-radix4"`, `"ct-radix8"`, `"ct-splitradix"`, `"stockham"`, and
  `"bluestein"` are now gated the same way the `"composite"`/`"winograd"`/
  `"generic"`/`"rader"`/mixed-radix arms already were.

### Fixed

- **`GuruPlan` negative-effective-offset checks promoted from
  `debug_assert!` to `assert!`.** A negative element offset (computable from
  user-supplied `IoDim` strides) used to be caught with a clear diagnostic in
  debug builds only; release builds indexed with the near-`usize::MAX` cast
  instead and panicked with an opaque out-of-bounds message. Both build
  profiles now report the same named diagnostic.
- **`ThreadPool::parallel_for_chunks` / `parallel_split` no longer divide by
  zero, overflow, or underflow** on degenerate arguments (`chunk_size == 0`,
  `count == 0`, `chunk_size` near `usize::MAX`, a ragged final chunk, or
  `min_chunk_size == 0`); these are provided trait methods on a public trait
  with no documented preconditions, so any argument a caller can type now
  behaves predictably (a zero chunk size is treated as no work) instead of
  panicking or recursing until the stack overflows.
- **`DftPlan::awake`** no longer carries a `WakeMode::Full` comment
  (`// Initialize twiddle factors, etc.`) describing work the match arm never
  did; both `WakeMode` arms are collapsed into the one real effect (setting
  the wake state), with a doc comment explaining why and where real
  twiddle-cache priming would go if this plan ever gains owned state.

### Documentation

- **SVE and WebAssembly SIMD claims corrected** in `README.md`,
  `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `oxifft.md`, and the `sve` feature comment in
  `oxifft/Cargo.toml`: both were advertised as runtime-detected SIMD
  backends, but neither is wired into any transform path today. SVE now
  reads a real vector length from `/proc/sys/abi/sve_default_vector_length`
  on aarch64 Linux (new `simd::parse_sve_vector_length_bytes`, pure Rust, no
  `libc`) instead of the previous hardcoded 0, and is documented as
  capability/length-detection only; WebAssembly is documented as scalar
  today, with the implemented-but-unwired `WasmSimdF64`/`WasmSimdF32`
  backend noted as a future dispatch target.
- Added `rustfmt.toml` (pins `edition = "2021"`; the existing tree already
  conformed to rustfmt's stable defaults, so this adds no reformatting) and
  `clippy.toml` (`msrv = "1.87"`, matching `[workspace.package] rust-version`).
- Added `SECURITY.md` (disclosure process, unsafe/soundness scope, untrusted
  wisdom-parser threat model, fuzz target inventory).
- Added `# Panics` sections to the public convenience functions in
  `api/plan/functions.rs`, `api/plan/types_nd.rs`, and `api/plan/types_real.rs`
  that call `.expect()` on an internal (fallible-by-signature) plan
  constructor.
- `TODO.md`'s Phase 7 "CI/CD" checklist no longer claims GitHub Actions
  workflows are set up; the repository policy (publish workflows only) means
  there is no CI, which the later Platform Matrix section already stated.
  Live test-population figures (`TODO.md`, `README.md`) updated to the
  measured `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features` / `cargo test --doc
  --workspace --all-features` counts; the historical v0.2.0/v0.1.0 figures
  are left as point-in-time records for those releases.

### Added

- 5th fuzz target (`wisdom_measure_roundtrip`): imports a fuzzer-controlled
  wisdom string, then plans and executes with `Flags::MEASURE` /
  `Flags::WISDOM_ONLY` — the path that reaches the
  `algorithm_from_solver_name` gating above.
- `scripts/feature_matrix_sweep.sh`: hand-rolled (no `cargo-hack`) compile
  sweep over `--all-features`, every individual feature, `--no-default-features`,
  the documented no_std feature combinations, and the `thumbv7em-none-eabihf`
  embedded target.

### Fixed (fuzz harness, not production code)

- **`fuzz_targets/r2c_roundtrip.rs`'s per-element error tolerance** no longer
  compares each reconstructed element only against its own magnitude. A
  fuzzer-found input mixing one huge value with a near-zero value elsewhere
  in the same (small) input made a legitimate floating-point roundoff error
  at the near-zero index — which scales with the *largest* magnitude
  anywhere in the input, not with that element's own value — look like a
  round-trip correctness bug. The tolerance is now `atol + rtol *
  expected.abs()`, with `atol` scaled to the input's dynamic range; the
  crash-triggering input is preserved as a permanent regression seed in the
  (gitignored) local fuzz corpus.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- `oxicuda-driver` / `oxicuda-fft` / `oxicuda-metal` (optional GPU backends)
  updated from 0.5.2 to 0.5.3.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-27

### Breaking Changes

- **`oxifft::kernel::{Solver, ProblemHash, hash_problem}` removed.** `Solver`
  had zero implementors and `ProblemHash`/`hash_problem` were dead,
  misleadingly-commented code; `kernel::planner::Planner` /
  `kernel::wisdom::WisdomEntry` are the real, wired-in candidate model.
- **`auto_tune::tune_size` gained a `flags: Flags` parameter.** Callers must
  now pass planning flags; `MEASURE`/`PATIENT`/`EXHAUSTIVE` widen the
  candidate set that gets profiled (radix-4/8, split-radix, Stockham,
  cache-oblivious, generic, Rader, mixed-radix, …) instead of only timing the
  single heuristic-chosen algorithm.
- **`Flags::WISDOM_ONLY` added**, matching FFTW's `FFTW_WISDOM_ONLY`: plan
  construction now fails (`None`) when no matching wisdom exists instead of
  silently falling back to a fresh heuristic/measured plan.
- **Wisdom binary format v2** (`BINARY_FORMAT_VERSION` bumped to 2): the v1
  encoding used a fixed 30-byte entry layout and a `u16`-bounded factor count,
  both of which could silently truncate `MixedRadix` solver names with many
  factors. v2 uses variable-length factor lists with an explicit `u32` entry
  count. `from_binary` still reads v1 files; `to_binary`/`to_binary_checked`
  now always write v2.
- **Workspace `rust-version` corrected from `1.75` to `1.87`.** `1.75` was
  aspirational, not actual: `hashbrown` 0.17 (a default-feature, non-optional
  dependency) requires edition2024/rust-version 1.85 at the dependency-
  resolution level alone, and `oxifft`'s own `ntt`/`nufft` modules use
  `u32::is_multiple_of`, stabilized in 1.87. Verified empirically with
  `cargo +<toolchain> check -p oxifft --locked` across rustup toolchains
  1.75.0, 1.77.1, 1.82.0, 1.85.0, 1.86.0 (all fail) and 1.87.0, 1.88.0 (both
  succeed).

### Added

- **`oxifft-adapter-mpi`: distributed real transforms (`MpiRealPlan2D`,
  `MpiRealPlan3D`).** Slab-decomposed r2c/c2r in the FFTW half-complex layout
  (a real last dimension of size `n` is stored as `n/2 + 1` complex
  coefficients; odd last dims supported). c2r is normalized by
  `1 / product(dims)`, consistent with the core `RealPlan*::execute_c2r`
  (deliberately unlike FFTW, which leaves c2r unnormalized), so an r2c -> c2r
  round trip is the identity. r2c honours `MpiFlags::transposed_out`. Added
  `local_size_2d_r2c` / `local_size_3d_r2c` allocation-size helpers.

### Changed

- **`oxifft::Plan::dft_1d` is now flag-aware and wisdom-cached.** `ESTIMATE`
  keeps the pure heuristic; `MEASURE`/`PATIENT`/`EXHAUSTIVE` consult the
  runtime wisdom cache (`lookup_wisdom`) first, and on a miss, benchmark real
  candidate algorithms and cache the winner (`store_wisdom`) so repeated
  `MEASURE` planning of the same size no longer re-benchmarks on every call.
- Added `Algorithm::Rader` and `Algorithm::CacheOblivious`;
  `algorithm_from_solver_name` now reconstructs all stateful solvers so
  imported/measured wisdom actually feeds back into plan selection. Rader is
  now selected by the `ESTIMATE` heuristic for primes in `17..=1021`.
- `oxifft-bench`'s `rustfft` dependency is now optional and feature-gated
  (`rustfft-compare`, on by default — mirrors the existing, already-optional
  `fftw-compare`/`fftw` pairing) instead of an unconditional dependency. The
  default `cargo build`/`cargo bench -p oxifft-bench` experience is
  unchanged. `oxifft-bench` remains `publish = false`.
- `oxifft-codegen-impl`'s crates.io category corrected from the copy-pasted
  `development-tools::procedural-macro-helpers` (it is not a proc-macro
  crate) to `["development-tools", "algorithms"]`.
- **`oxifft-adapter-mpi`: `MpiPlanND::distributed_fft_dim0` now uses a single
  `alltoallv`-based transpose** (was one blocking `all_gather_v` per fiber):
  two collectives total regardless of fiber count, each rank holds only its
  `1/P` share of the transposed data instead of gathering full fibers.
  Validated under `mpirun -n 1/2/3/4`.

### Dependencies

- `oxicuda-driver` / `oxicuda-fft` / `oxicuda-metal` (optional GPU backends)
  bumped from 0.1.8 → 0.5.1 across five incremental updates. CUDA execution
  remains an honest CPU-fallback (`GpuFft::execution_target` returns
  `ExecutionTarget::Cpu` for the CUDA backend; Metal returns `Gpu`) pending
  device-side FFT support landing in `oxicuda-fft` itself — the bump tracks
  upstream API changes only, no behavior change on the `oxifft` side.

### Fixed / Dependency & Packaging Hygiene

- **Added `deny.toml`** at the workspace root enforcing the COOLJAPAN
  banned-crate policy (openblas, bincode, rustfft, Z3, rusqlite, zip, flate2,
  zstd, bzip2, lz4, tar, snap, brotli, miniz_oxide) via `cargo deny check
  bans`, with narrow, documented `wrappers` exceptions scoped only to
  `oxifft-bench` (`publish = false`) and its comparison-benchmark
  dependencies (`rustfft`, and the `fftw` → `fftw-sys` → `fftw-src` → `zip` →
  {`flate2` → `miniz_oxide`, `zstd`, `bzip2`} chain behind the non-default
  `fftw-compare` feature). `cargo deny check` (bans + licenses + advisories +
  sources) passes clean on this workspace as of this release.
- Fixed workspace dependency-inheritance violations: `oxifft/Cargo.toml`'s
  stale `oxifft-codegen = "0.3.1"` local pin, `oxifft-adapter-mpi/Cargo.toml`'s
  local pin on `oxifft`, and `oxifft-codegen/Cargo.toml`'s local `trybuild`
  dev-dependency pin now all route through `[workspace.dependencies]` /
  `.workspace = true`, matching the existing `oxifft-codegen-impl` pattern.
- Removed the dead `seahash` dependency (its only consumer, `kernel/hash.rs`,
  was deleted as part of the planner/wisdom rework above) and the dead
  workspace `libc` dependency (declared "for SVE detection" but never
  referenced anywhere; SVE detection uses
  `std::arch::is_aarch64_feature_detected!` instead).
- Added `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` to all four publishable crates
  (`oxifft`, `oxifft-codegen`, `oxifft-codegen-impl`, `oxifft-adapter-mpi`).
  `oxifft`'s docs.rs build now uses a curated feature list (`std`,
  `threading`, `avx512`, `f128-support`, `f16-support`, `sparse`, `pruned`,
  `sve`, `wasm`, `streaming`, `const-fft`, `signal`, `fftw-compat`, `ndarray`)
  rather than `all-features`, since `cuda`/`metal`/`gpu` pull in
  `oxicuda-metal`'s `metal` crate dependency, which does not build on
  docs.rs's Linux container.
- Added a real `README.md` for `oxifft-adapter-mpi` (previously shipped with
  no readme at all) documenting what the crate is, its MPI/libclang build
  prerequisites, a quickstart, and the `mpirun` integration-check workflow;
  added `readme = "README.md"` to its `Cargo.toml`.
- Every publishable crate (`oxifft`, `oxifft-codegen`, `oxifft-codegen-impl`,
  `oxifft-adapter-mpi`) now ships its own copy of `LICENSE` in its package
  tarball (previously only the workspace-root `LICENSE` existed, which is not
  auto-included in any individual crate's `cargo package` output).
- Excluded the prebuilt `pkg_simd/` wasm-pack artifacts (`.wasm`/`.js`/
  `.d.ts`, still tracked in git from before a `.gitignore` rule was added for
  them) from the `oxifft` crate's crates.io tarball via `Cargo.toml`'s
  `exclude` list — `.gitignore` cannot retroactively untrack already-committed
  files, so this is the mechanism that actually keeps them out of `cargo
  package`.
- Added `default-members = ["oxifft", "oxifft-codegen", "oxifft-codegen-impl",
  "oxifft-bench"]` to the workspace so a plain `cargo build`/`cargo test` at
  the repository root no longer requires a system MPI implementation or
  `libclang`; `oxifft-adapter-mpi` remains fully buildable via
  `cargo build --workspace` or `cargo build -p oxifft-adapter-mpi`.
- **`no_std` SIMD compilation fixed across both the generated and hand-written
  AVX-512 paths.** The codegen-emitted dispatchers (`gen_simd_codelet!`,
  `gen_dispatcher_codelet!`) are now fully `no_std`-safe: x86 feature detection
  goes through a self-contained, block-local `macro_rules!` that expands to
  `is_x86_feature_detected!` under `std` and to `cfg!(target_feature = ...)`
  under `no_std` (matched as `:tt`, not `:literal`, so `std_detect` sees the
  raw feature literal — a `:literal` fragment tripped a spurious "unknown x86
  target feature" error under `--features avx512,std`); the AVX-512 f32 size-16
  twiddles are precomputed into literal constants at proc-macro expansion time
  rather than emitting runtime `.sin()`/`.cos()` calls; and no `::std::` paths
  are emitted (aarch64 NEON is assumed, matching the uncached dispatcher). With
  the emitted code self-contained, the previously `std`-gated cached size-4
  dispatchers in `generated_simd.rs` are now available under `no_std` too. The
  hand-written AVX-512 codelets were fixed the same way: the dispatch wrappers
  route `avx512f` detection through the crate's `detect_x86_feature!` macro
  instead of the `std`-only `is_x86_feature_detected!`, and the precomputed
  twiddle-table builders resolve `sin_cos` via `num_traits::Float` under
  `no_std`. `cargo check -p oxifft --no-default-features --features avx512
  --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and the `--features avx512,std` variant
  both build clean.
- Fixed two remaining lint warnings found in final full-workspace
  verification: a `clippy::manual_midpoint` hit in
  `const_fft::radix2::ifft2_inplace` (now uses `f64::midpoint`, stabilized in
  the crate's MSRV 1.87) and a `rustdoc::private_intra_doc_links` warning in
  `oxifft-codegen-impl/src/gen_simd/mod.rs` (doc comment referenced the
  private `gen_x86_detect_macro` helper via `[...]` link syntax, which cannot
  resolve to a private item). `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
  --all-features` and `cargo doc --workspace --all-features --no-deps` are
  both zero-warning as of this release. Full gate re-verification: 1730
  tests passing workspace-wide, doctests passing, `cargo deny check` clean,
  `mpirun -n 2` / `-n 4` MPI integration tests passing.
- **Fixed release-build-only test flakiness in `kernel::twiddle`'s SoA-vs-AoS
  parity tests** (`soa_vs_aos_correctness_f64_{1024,4096,16384,65536}`):
  these passed under `cargo nextest run` (debug) but failed under `--release`,
  up to 2048 ULP apart at specific (size, index) pairs. Root cause: the AoS
  and SoA twiddle-table builders (`compute_twiddle_table_f64` vs
  `compute_twiddle_table_soa_f64`) use the identical scalar formula but as
  structurally different loops (iterator `.map().collect()` vs manual `for`
  + `.push()`), so under `-O` LLVM's auto-vectorizer is free to choose
  different, individually-valid instruction sequences for the division
  feeding `cos`/`sin` in each — a sub-ULP input perturbation that can
  occasionally amplify to a few thousand ULP in the trig output for specific
  inputs, without either path being wrong. A raw ULP bound is the wrong tool
  for comparing two independently-vectorized-and-compiled code paths for
  exactly this reason; the tests (f64 and f32 variants) now use an
  absolute/relative-error gate (`1e-11`/`1e-9` for f64, `1e-6`/`1e-5` for
  f32) that comfortably clears the observed noise (worst case ~4.5e-13
  relative) while staying far tighter than any real algorithmic bug would
  produce. No production code changed — this was a test-tolerance defect
  only, caught by adding a `cargo nextest run --release` pass (not
  previously part of this project's verification gates) to `/final-call`.

### Known Issues (tracked, not fixed this release)

- `syn` stays pinned to the 2.0 major workspace-wide (crates.io's current
  major is 3.0) because migrating `oxifft-codegen`/`oxifft-codegen-impl`'s
  proc-macro internals to syn 3.0 is a real source migration, not a drop-in
  bump. `serde_derive` already pulls in syn 3.0 transitively, so both majors
  compile in every build regardless; `cargo deny`'s `multiple-versions`
  duplicate check is informed of this via a documented `skip` entry.
- `oxifft-bench --no-default-features` does not build:
  `utils::rustfft_forward`/`utils::rustfft_inverse` and the `fft_comparison`
  bench still reference `rustfft` unconditionally in source. The
  `rustfft-compare` feature (on by default) makes the dependency itself
  optional at the `Cargo.toml` level, but the call sites in
  `oxifft-bench/src/utils.rs` need `#[cfg(feature = "rustfft-compare")]`
  guards to fully honor `--no-default-features`; default-feature builds are
  unaffected.
- `oxifft-adapter-mpi`'s docs.rs build is expected to fail regardless of its
  `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` stanza: its single, non-optional `mpi`
  dependency requires a real MPI implementation and `libclang` at build time,
  neither available on the docs.rs container, and there is no Cargo-level way
  to make a non-optional dependency skip that requirement.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Multi-rank 3D pencil FFT execution**: `plan_3d_pencil` now supports multi-rank MPI
  execution with full forward/inverse pencil decomposition. Expanded `plan_nd` error
  handling for ND FFT plans.

### Changed

- **AVX-512 codelets and dispatchers gated behind a new default-off `avx512` feature**:
  `rustc` 1.95 stable treats `#[target_feature(enable = "avx512*")]` as unstable
  (rust-lang/rust#44839). Without `--features avx512`, builds fall through to the
  existing AVX-2 / SSE / scalar dispatch paths. No API or ABI change when the feature
  is enabled. Both `oxifft` and `oxifft-codegen-impl` are updated in concert.
- **Refactored error handling for row and column pools** in multi-rank 3D pencil FFT
  execution (`plan_3d_pencil`, `plan_nd`).

### Dependencies

- `oxicuda` (optional GPU backend) bumped from 0.1.4 → 0.1.8 across four incremental
  updates (0.1.5, 0.1.6, 0.1.7, 0.1.8).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Mixed-radix Cooley-Tukey FFT** for smooth-7 sizes factoring into {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16}
  (6, 10, 12, 14, 24, 28, 40, 56, 80, 96, 112, 240, …). Uses Winograd minimum-multiply
  radix-3/5/7 DIT butterflies; replaces Bluestein for these sizes with a proper cost model.
- **Auto-tuning** (`Flags::MEASURE` / `Flags::PATIENT`): runtime profiling of candidate
  algorithms via `auto_tune::tune_size<T>` / `tune_range<T>`. Binary wisdom format
  (30-byte packed LE entries). Build-time profiling opt-in via `OXIFFT_TUNE=1`.
  New `oxifft_tune` CLI binary for offline profiling.
- **`gen_any_codelet!` proc-macro** and `CodeletBuilder` API in `oxifft-codegen`:
  dispatches to direct codelets / Rader / MixedRadix / Bluestein for any user-specified N.
- **Wisdom format v2**: S-expression format with `(mixed-radix-R1-R2-...)` encoding;
  backward-compatible with v1 files.

### Changed
- 325 new tests; total workspace: **1 554 passing** (up from 1 229 in v0.3.0).
- `oxifft-codegen` now has 11 proc-macros (added `gen_any_codelet!`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-25

### Performance

- **Performance:** `R2rPlan` now caches `R2rSolver` at construction; solver twiddle tables and FFT plans are built once and reused on every `execute()` call, eliminating 2 Plan constructions + 2561 sin_cos calls per dct2_1024 invocation (v1.0 parity gate: dct2_1024 < 3.0×)

### Added

- DCT-II/III/IV FFT-based implementations via Makhoul reduction (N-point R2C + O(N)
  post-twiddle), replacing 2N/4N complex DFT approach; ~4× flop reduction vs v0.2.0.
  (`oxifft/src/rdft/solvers/r2r.rs`)
- R2r/R2c solver plan caching (`Option<Plan<T>>` + pre-computed twiddle tables)
  eliminating per-call `Plan::dft_1d` construction.
- Bluestein + Rader AoS SIMD pointwise-multiply helpers (`kernel/complex_mul.rs`:
  `complex_mul_aos_f64`, `complex_mul_aos_f32`) with AVX2+FMA, NEON, SSE2, scalar dispatch.
- Thread-local scratch for Bluestein/Rader keyed by solver ID, removing mutex contention.
- FFTW parity gate benchmark harness: 7 gates (1024 complex, 2^20 complex, 1024 real,
  1024×1024 2D, 1000×256 batch, 2017 prime, 1024 DCT-II) at
  `oxifft-bench/benches/fftw_parity_gates.rs`.
- FFTW parity ratio baseline JSON committed at `benches/baselines/v0.3.0/`.
- GPU batch FFT with automatic chunking (`gpu/batch.rs`,
  `METAL_BATCH_LIMIT=1024`, `CUDA_BATCH_LIMIT=4096`).
- Pencil decomposition for 3D MPI FFT (`mpi/plans/plan_3d_pencil.rs`).
- Real WASM SIMD v128 intrinsics via `core::arch::wasm32` with module-split fallback for
  non-simd128 targets (`wasm/simd.rs`).
- Work-stealing `WorkStealingContext` for Plan2D/Plan3D with user-pool override
  (`threading/work_stealing.rs`).
- `Send + Sync` compile-time assertions on all public plan types (`assertions.rs`).
- Hand-optimized AVX-512 codelets for sizes 16/32/64
  (`dft/codelets/hand_avx512.rs`, `dft/codelets/hand_avx512_twiddles.rs`).
- Cache-oblivious Frigo-Johnson 4-step FFT (`dft/solvers/cache_oblivious.rs`).
- Criterion DCT/DST benchmark group (`oxifft/benches/dct_benchmarks.rs`,
  `oxifft-bench/benches/dct_dst.rs`).
- Criterion R2C/C2R regression tracker (`oxifft-bench/benches/r2c_c2r.rs`).
- GPU vs CPU benchmark at 4096/16384/65536/262144 (`oxifft/benches/gpu_vs_cpu.rs`).
- Multi-dimensional NUFFT (2D/3D) (`nufft/nufft2d.rs`, `nufft3d.rs`).
- SoA twiddle layout for CT sizes ≥ 4096, reducing SIMD shuffle count
  (`kernel/twiddle.rs`).
- `GpuBatchFft<T>` trait for N independent same-size FFTs in a single GPU submission.
- Overlap-save STFT method as alternative to overlap-add (`streaming/stft.rs`).

### Changed

- DCT-II default path now FFT-based for n ≥ 16 (O(n log n)); O(n²) retained as reference
  fallback for n < 16.
- Metal backend uses real device probe via `oxicuda_metal::device::MetalDevice::new()`
  (was hardcoded placeholder).
- CUDA backend uses real driver probe via `oxicuda_driver::init()` (was filesystem check).
  GPU kernel dispatch uses CPU fallback pending `oxicuda-launch` integration.
- NEON dispatch wired into small-size path (sizes 2/4/8); no more scalar fallback on
  aarch64.
- Production `.unwrap()` removed from `rader_omega.rs`, `spectral.rs`, `threading/mod.rs`
  (test-only sites retained).
- SVE detection now uses `std::arch::is_aarch64_feature_detected!("sve")` instead of
  `libc::getauxval`; `libc` dependency removed.
- `#![warn(clippy::missing_safety_doc)]` and `#![warn(clippy::missing_errors_doc)]` added
  to `lib.rs` as compile-enforced invariants.

### Removed

- `GpuBackend::OpenCL` and `GpuBackend::Vulkan` placeholder variants (never had backing
  code; downstream match exhaustiveness breakage is acceptable pre-1.0).

### Fixed

- Bluestein `execute_inplace` no longer allocates via `to_vec()` — uses dedicated
  thread-local scratch.
- Rader `execute_inplace` mirrored fix.
- NEON `dit_64`/`dit_128`/`dit_512` eliminate stack round-trip in butterfly loops.

### Performance

- DCT-II @ 1024: ~4× faster vs v0.2.0 (O(n log n) vs O(n²)).
  FFTW ratio: v0.2.0 baseline 7.39× → see `benches/baselines/v0.3.0/` for post-Makhoul
  measurement.
- Power-of-2 1D complex FFT: see `benches/baselines/v0.3.0/` for FFTW ratio snapshots.

### Documentation

- `# Safety` rustdoc added to all 84+ unsafe functions (enforced via
  `#![warn(clippy::missing_safety_doc)]`).
- `# Errors` rustdoc added to 84+ fallible public functions (enforced via
  `#![warn(clippy::missing_errors_doc)]`).
- 1360 tests passing (up from 858 in v0.2.0).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-14

### Breaking Changes

- `Plan::dft_2d()` now returns `Option<Plan2D<T>>` instead of `Option<Plan<T>>`.
  Previously panicked at runtime; this is a compile-time breaking change that prevents a runtime crash.
- `Plan::dft_3d()` now returns `Option<Plan3D<T>>` instead of `Option<Plan<T>>`.
  Previously panicked at runtime; this is a compile-time breaking change that prevents a runtime crash.
- `Plan::r2c_1d()` now returns `Option<RealPlan<T>>` instead of `Option<Plan<T>>`.
  Previously panicked at runtime; this is a compile-time breaking change that prevents a runtime crash.
- `Plan::c2r_1d()` now returns `Option<RealPlan<T>>` instead of `Option<Plan<T>>`.
  Previously panicked at runtime; this is a compile-time breaking change that prevents a runtime crash.
- `IndirectStrategy` enum and its `IndexArray` variant removed (was dead code, never constructed).
- All public enums are now `#[non_exhaustive]`. Downstream `match` expressions on public enums
  need a wildcard `_ => ...` arm.

### New Features

- **FFTW Compatibility API** (`fftw-compat` feature): `oxifft::compat` module with FFTW-style
  function names (`fftw_plan_dft_1d`, `fftw_plan_dft_2d`, `fftw_execute`, etc.).
- `Debug` impl on all public plan types.
- `#[must_use]` on all plan creation methods returning `Option<Plan...>`.

### Improvements

- Reduced crate-level `#[allow(clippy::...)]` from 60 to under 30 by fixing underlying lint sites.
- Hardened FFAST sparse FFT peeling decoder for edge cases (k=0, k=n, pure noise).
- Added property-based tests for sparse FFT and all DCT/DST variants.

### Fixes

- Eliminated 6 runtime panics reachable from public API (4 `todo!()` + 2 `unimplemented!()`).
- Removed dead `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes in production code.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Mel-frequency analysis** (`streaming` feature):
  - `MelConfig` struct for mel filterbank configuration (sample rate, FFT size, hop size, n_mels, f_min, f_max)
  - `build_mel_filterbank()` — builds triangular mel filterbank matrix

  - `mfcc()` — Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients via DCT of log-mel spectrogram
- **Example**: `signal_processing.rs` demonstrating all signal module functions

### Changed

- **SIMD codelet refactor**: Split `dft/codelets/simd.rs` (2813 lines, exceeding the 2000-line policy) into a directory module `dft/codelets/simd/` with 5 focused files:

  - `backends.rs` (517 lines): SSE2, AVX2, NEON, and x86_64 SIMD backend implementations
  - `small_sizes.rs` (95 lines): f64-specific SIMD dispatch for sizes 2–32
  - `large_sizes.rs` (1600 lines): f64-specific SIMD dispatch for sizes 64–4096 with precomputed twiddles
  - `tests.rs` (360 lines): correctness and roundtrip tests for SIMD codelets

- **Version bump**: 0.1.3 → 0.1.4

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- **CUDA SIMD fallback infinite recursion**: Fixed infinite recursion bug in `notw_512_dispatch`, `notw_1024_dispatch`, and `notw_4096_dispatch` SIMD fallback paths
  - The fallback for non-f32/f64 types previously called `CooleyTukeySolver::execute`, which dispatched back to the same codelet, causing infinite recursion
  - Now calls `CooleyTukeySolver::execute_dit_inplace` directly to perform iterative DIT without re-entering the codelet dispatch
  - Made `execute_dit_inplace` public on `CooleyTukeySolver` to support this fix
  - Removed unnecessary `output` buffer allocation in fallback paths

### Changed

- **License consolidation**: Consolidated dual license files (`LICENSE-APACHE` + `LICENSE-MIT`) into a single `LICENSE` file (Apache-2.0)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- **Windows compatibility**: Removed `examples/**/CLAUDE.md` directory which caused package unpacking errors on Windows
  - Windows does not allow `**` as directory or filename
  - Error: "The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. (os error 123)"
  - This fix enables cross-platform PyPI publishing for dependent crates (e.g., scirs2-python)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- **Dependency updates**:
  - `hashbrown`: 0.15.5 → 0.16.1
  - `spin`: 0.9.8 → 0.10.0
- Removed `rust-version` field (MSRV) to allow using latest Rust features

### Fixed

- **48 clippy warnings eliminated**:
  - `manual_is_multiple_of`: Replaced `n % x == 0` with `n.is_multiple_of(x)`
  - `ref_as_ptr`: Replaced `x as *const _` with `std::ptr::from_ref(x)`
- All tests passing (652 tests)
- Zero clippy warnings with `-D warnings`
