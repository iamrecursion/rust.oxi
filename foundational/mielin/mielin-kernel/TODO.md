# mielin-kernel TODO

## Pending Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Integration tests on real hardware (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone)

### Medium Priority
- [x] Explore Rust async runtime integration — SleepFuture, PeriodicTimer, AsyncTimerRegistry, tick integration; 26 tests in async_timer.rs
- [x] Research lock-free algorithms for scheduler — WorkStealingScheduler (Chase-Lev, work_stealing.rs) activated; 32 tests (17 original + 15 new integration)

### Low Priority
- [ ] Video tutorial for kernel development
- [ ] Set up discussions forum
- [x] Investigate compiler-rt optimizations — mielin_memcpy/memmove/memset/memcmp (8-byte aligned fast paths), soft udivmod64/sdivmod64, clz/ctz/popcount/bswap/rotl/rotr (32+64-bit), bit extraction, const_time_eq, hex_encode; 39 tests in compiler_rt.rs
- [x] Explore kernel bypass techniques (DPDK-style) — PollModeDriver, PacketRing (SPSC lockfree), DmaPool, ForwardingPipeline; 27 tests in bypass_net.rs
- [x] Investigate eBPF-style extensibility — MielinBPF VM implemented (bpf/ subdir: ISA, verifier, interpreter, tracepoint registry; 67 tests)

### Future Enhancements
- [x] Virtual memory enhancements — vmm.rs split into vmm/ (7 files all <1000 lines); guard pages, flush_tlb_range, map_stack_guarded added
- [x] Advanced memory management features — BuddyAllocator: power-of-2 split/coalesce, 6-variant error type, fragmentation stats; 36 tests in buddy.rs

## Completed Features (v0.1.0-rc.1)

The following major features have been implemented and are production-ready:

- ✅ Heap allocator integration with global allocator trait
- ✅ Priority-based cooperative task scheduler
- ✅ Async/await executor with Future trait support
- ✅ Multi-core support with cross-CPU task migration
- ✅ Real-time scheduling features (deadline, periodic tasks)
- ✅ Inter-CPU communication (IPC) infrastructure
- ✅ Copy-on-Write (COW) pages
- ✅ Demand paging
- ✅ Huge pages support
- ✅ Power management (CPU frequency scaling, sleep states)
- ✅ Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO)
- ✅ Shared memory regions
- ✅ Runtime configuration system
- ✅ Interrupt handling and timer subsystems
- ✅ Virtual memory management
- ✅ Embedded optimizations
- ✅ Observability infrastructure (metrics, tracing)
- ✅ Production hardening (error handling, resource limits)
- ✅ Multi-architecture support (x86_64, AArch64, RISC-V, Cortex-M)
- ✅ Thread-safe operations with spin locks
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (100% coverage)
- ✅ Documentation and examples
