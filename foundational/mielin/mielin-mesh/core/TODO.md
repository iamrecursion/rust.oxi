# mielin-mesh-core TODO

## Pending Tasks

### High Priority
- [x] Test with 100+ node cluster — 29 tests at 100/200/500/1000-node scale in large_cluster_tests.rs
- [x] Network partition simulation — partition_50_50_split, majority/minority quorum, partition healing, cascading splits; 36 tests in chaos_tests.rs
- [x] Chaos engineering (node failures, network delays) — ChaosEngine with kill/recover/partition/heal, mass failure, random flap; 36 tests in chaos_tests.rs

### Medium Priority
- [x] Benchmark gossip convergence — convergence timing, fanout effect, consistent-hash lookup, quorum throughput; benchmarks in chaos_tests.rs
- [x] Performance regression tests — 5 bench tests (100-node throughput, 1K-node ring, 200-node partition sweep, 500-node gossip) in large_cluster_tests.rs
- [x] Cross-platform networking tests
- [x] Production features hardening — StaticPeerList (weighted selection, health tracking, prune), DnsSrvDiscovery (inject+cache, priority tiers), DiscoveryAggregator (multi-source dedup); 28 tests

### Low Priority
- [x] Support for alternative discovery mechanisms — StaticPeerList, DnsSrvDiscovery (RFC 2782 SRV), DiscoveryAggregator (multi-source fan-out with dedup); 28 tests in discovery_static/dns/aggregator.rs
- [x] Configurable gossip protocols — GossipConfig struct with gossip_interval/heartbeat_timeout/failure_timeout/fanout/max_history; GossipState::with_config()
- [x] Historical membership queries — MembershipEvent log with membership_history/history_for/history_since; bounded VecDeque ring
- [x] Networking architecture guide — docs/NETWORKING.md (grounded in dht/gossip/routing/discovery/partition) (2026-07-11)
- [x] Deployment guide — docs/DEPLOYMENT.md (2026-07-11)
- [x] Gossip protocol documentation — docs/NETWORKING.md §3 (GossipConfig, super-peer election, anti-entropy) (2026-07-11)
- [x] Troubleshooting guide — docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md (2026-07-11)
- [ ] Video tutorials for mesh setup — DEFERRED (media production; not actionable in-repo)
