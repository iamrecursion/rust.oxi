# mielin-wasm TODO

## Pending Tasks

### High Priority
- [x] WASI Preview 2 / Component Model support — ComponentExecutor with wasmtime-wasi p2 add_to_linker_async; WIT world at wit/mielin.wit; 3 integration tests under `--features preview2`

### Low Priority
- [ ] Video tutorials for WASM development

## Completed Features (v0.1.0-rc.1)

The following major features have been implemented and are production-ready:

### Core Runtime
- ✅ Wasmtime integration with custom configuration
- ✅ Module compilation and validation
- ✅ WASM magic number verification
- ✅ Memory snapshot capture for migration
- ✅ Module caching with persistent storage
- ✅ Async execution support with cooperative yielding
- ✅ Fuel-based execution limiting
- ✅ Timeout enforcement

### Security
- ✅ Capability-based security sandbox
- ✅ Fine-grained permission system (FileSystem, Network, Camera, GPIO)
- ✅ Zero-trust security model
- ✅ Path sanitization and directory traversal prevention

### Memory Management
- ✅ Memory limits enforcement with presets
- ✅ Memory growth callbacks
- ✅ Memory statistics with peak tracking
- ✅ Compressed snapshot support

### Host Functions
- ✅ System functions (time, random, env, process info)
- ✅ Filesystem operations (read/write, directories)
- ✅ Network operations (TCP/UDP sockets, DNS)
- ✅ TensorLogic integration (tensor creation and operations)
- ✅ Hardware capability queries

### Performance
- ✅ JIT optimization with profile-guided compilation
- ✅ Hot function compilation
- ✅ Inline caching
- ✅ Tiered compilation
- ✅ Module instance pooling
- ✅ Memory page deduplication

### Testing & Quality
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (1000+ tests)
- ✅ Component model tests
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility tests
- ✅ Debug and validation infrastructure
- ✅ Memory leak detection
- ✅ Stress testing
