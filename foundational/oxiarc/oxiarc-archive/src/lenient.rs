//! Lenient-mode recovery primitives for archive readers.
//!
//! When a reader is configured in "lenient" mode (via a format-specific
//! builder such as `ZipReader::lenient`), integrity failures that would
//! normally abort extraction are instead recorded as [`LenientWarning`]s
//! and the reader does its best to continue.
//!
//! This is intended for **best-effort recovery** of slightly-corrupt
//! archives — e.g. files with a few flipped bits, TAR archives with a
//! mangled header block mid-stream, or LZH archives whose entry data CRCs
//! do not match but whose surrounding structure is intact. Lenient mode
//! does NOT guarantee that the returned data is valid; callers MUST
//! inspect [`Reader::warnings`](crate::zip::ZipReader::warnings) and
//! decide how to handle non-empty warning lists.
//!
//! The format strings used in [`LenientWarning::format`] are currently
//! `"ZIP"`, `"TAR"`, and `"LZH"`.

/// A non-fatal integrity issue encountered during lenient-mode reading.
///
/// Warnings are accumulated on the reader and can be retrieved via the
/// per-format `.warnings()` accessor after an extraction or enumeration
/// operation. Each warning carries the archive format, an optional entry
/// name (when the failure is attributable to a specific entry), a
/// machine-readable [`LenientWarningKind`] discriminator, and a
/// human-readable message describing the condition.
