# OxiArc fuzz harnesses

This directory is a standalone `cargo-fuzz` crate (it is **not** a member of
the root workspace — see the top-level `[workspace]` table in
`fuzz/Cargo.toml` — so it manages its own `Cargo.lock` and does not
participate in the main workspace's dependency resolution).

## Prerequisites

```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
```

`cargo-fuzz` requires a nightly toolchain (for `-Z sanitizer=address` /
libFuzzer instrumentation) even though the rest of the OxiArc workspace
builds on stable.

## Building all targets

```bash
cd fuzz
cargo +nightly fuzz build
```

Build a single target:

```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz build fuzz_snappy_crc32c
```

## Running a target

```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_snappy_crc32c
```

Add `-- -max_len=65536` or other libFuzzer flags after a second `--` if
needed, e.g.:

```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_zip_read -- -max_len=1048576 -timeout=10
```

Each run keeps discovered crashes under `fuzz/artifacts/<target>/` and a
growing corpus under `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` (both are fuzz-crate-local,
untracked scratch state — see the ownership note below).

## Seeding corpora

Every target benefits from being seeded with small, valid samples of its
input format before a long fuzzing run, since libFuzzer's coverage-guided
mutation starts from whatever is in `fuzz/corpus/<target>/`. Handy sources
already in this repository:

- `oxiarc-archive/tests/data/*.tar`, `*.zip`, etc. — hand-crafted archive
  fixtures used by the crate's own integration tests.
- Any small, real-world `.gz`/`.zst`/`.lz4`/`.br`/`.sz`/`.lzh`/`.cab`/`.iso`/
  `.7z` sample file works too — a handful of KB is enough as a seed; the
  fuzzer discovers interesting mutations from there.

Example, seeding the zip reader from the archive crate's own test fixtures:

```bash
mkdir -p fuzz/corpus/fuzz_zip_read
cp ../oxiarc-archive/tests/data/*.zip fuzz/corpus/fuzz_zip_read/ 2>/dev/null || true
cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_zip_read
```

For the codec-level targets (`fuzz_inflate`, `fuzz_bzip2_decompress`,
`fuzz_lzma_decompress`, `fuzz_zstd_frame`, `fuzz_lz4_decompress`,
`fuzz_brotli_decompress`, `fuzz_snappy_decompress`, `fuzz_lzw_decompress`,
`fuzz_szip_decode`) a quick way to bootstrap a seed corpus is to compress a
handful of small files with each crate's own encoder and drop the output
into the matching `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` directory — the round-trip output
is a guaranteed-valid input for the corresponding decoder.

### Seeding a differential target from its own single-shot sibling

`fuzz_inflate_stream`, `fuzz_wrapped_inflate`, `fuzz_inflate_reader`,
`fuzz_zstd_stream` and `fuzz_brotli_stream` each drive a resumable/push
decoder and compare it against a plain, already-fuzzed single-shot
reference (`fuzz_inflate`, `fuzz_zlib_header`/`fuzz_gzip_header`,
`fuzz_zstd_frame`, `fuzz_brotli_decompress` respectively) — so the fastest
way to a useful corpus is copying that sibling's own corpus over, **prefixed
with the exact picker bytes the target's `Unstructured` consumes before
`take_rest()`** (verified against `arbitrary` 1.4.2's actual source:
`fill_buffer`/`bytes` consume from the front and never error on too little
data, so a 1-byte prefix reliably selects the intended branch). Without the
prefix, a bare copy is off by that many bytes and mostly parses as garbage.

```bash
cd fuzz
seed_prefixed() {  # <src corpus dir> <dst corpus dir> <picker-byte(s) as \xNN...>
  local src="$1" dst="$2" prefix_hex="$3" n=0
  mkdir -p "$dst"
  for f in "$src"/*; do
    [ -f "$f" ] || continue
    n=$((n+1)); [ "$n" -gt 150 ] && break
    printf "$prefix_hex" | cat - "$f" > "$dst/seed_${n}_$(basename "$f")"
  done
}

# 1-byte prefix (granularity_pick): any value works, GRANULARITIES[x % 8].
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_inflate           corpus/fuzz_inflate_stream '\x00'
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_zstd_frame        corpus/fuzz_zstd_stream    '\x00'
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_brotli_decompress corpus/fuzz_brotli_stream  '\x00'

# 2-byte prefix (wrapper_pick, granularity_pick); wrapper_pick % 4:
# 0=Raw 1=Zlib 2=Gzip 3=Auto — pick the byte to match the source corpus.
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_inflate     corpus/fuzz_wrapped_inflate '\x00\x00'  # Raw
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_zlib_header corpus/fuzz_wrapped_inflate '\x01\x00'  # Zlib
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_gzip_header corpus/fuzz_wrapped_inflate '\x02\x00'  # Gzip

# 5-byte prefix (wrapper_pick: u8, then size_seed: [u8; 4]); same wrapper mapping.
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_inflate     corpus/fuzz_inflate_reader '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'  # Raw
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_zlib_header corpus/fuzz_inflate_reader '\x01\x00\x00\x00\x00'  # Zlib
seed_prefixed corpus/fuzz_gzip_header corpus/fuzz_inflate_reader '\x02\x00\x00\x00\x00'  # Gzip

cargo +nightly fuzz run fuzz_zstd_stream -- -max_total_time=30
```

**Verify rather than trust**: compare libFuzzer's `cov:`/`ft:` counters on a
short run with and without the seeded corpus present — if coverage barely
moves, the byte-consumption assumption for this crate's `arbitrary` version
no longer holds and the prefix length needs rechecking against
`Unstructured`'s actual call sequence in the target's source, not assumed
from this table.

## Coverage / priority

Targets, in the priority order called out for this hardening pass:

1. **`fuzz_snappy_crc32c`** (highest priority) — `crc32c_sse42`
   (`oxiarc-snappy/src/crc32c.rs:65-95`) performs raw unaligned pointer reads
   over attacker-influenced data; this target sweeps buffer lengths and
   alignments (including a full prefix sweep) to hit every stride/tail
   branch of that routine via the safe, dispatching `crc32c()` entry point.
2. **`fuzz_archive_detect`** (high priority) — `ArchiveFormat::detect` /
   `from_magic` are the first code path any untrusted file hits before
   OxiArc even picks a format-specific parser.
3. All remaining codec (`fuzz_inflate`, `fuzz_gzip_header`,
   `fuzz_zlib_header`, `fuzz_bzip2_decompress`, `fuzz_lzma_decompress`,
   `fuzz_zstd_frame`, `fuzz_lz4_decompress`, `fuzz_brotli_decompress`,
   `fuzz_snappy_decompress`, `fuzz_lzh_decode`, `fuzz_lzw_decompress`,
   `fuzz_szip_decode`) and archive-container (`fuzz_zip_read`,
   `fuzz_tar_read`, `fuzz_cab_read`, `fuzz_iso9660_read`,
   `fuzz_sevenz_header`) entry points.
4. **Phase 8 workspace-integration targets** — the resumable/push decoders
   and the image codecs added in the P2/P3 program. These fall into three
   shapes:
   - *Differential* (a resumable decoder against its own whole-buffer
     reference, at randomised split granularities):
     `fuzz_inflate_stream` (`InflateStream` vs `oxiarc_deflate::inflate`),
     `fuzz_wrapped_inflate` (`WrappedInflate` fine vs coarse split, all four
     of `Raw`/`Zlib`/`Gzip`/`Auto`), `fuzz_inflate_reader` (`InflateReader`
     under adversarial short reads vs a direct `WrappedInflate` drive),
     `fuzz_brotli_stream` (`BrotliStream` vs `oxiarc_brotli::decompress`,
     with the harness's window capped at 1 MiB so a `WBITS = 24` input costs
     a refusal instead of a 16 MiB allocation — a `WindowTooLarge` from the
     chunked path is the one excluded divergence, see that target's module
     doc),
     `fuzz_zstd_stream` (`ZstdStream` vs `decompress_multi_frame`; accept/
     refuse agreement is asserted in both directions, not just "both accept
     ⇒ byte-equal" — see that target's module doc for the one documented
     exception, a declared-window ceiling split, and the history of how the
     other three initially-suspected exceptions were closed instead), and
     `fuzz_png_streaming` (`StreamingDecoder`'s event sequence, whole-buffer
     vs piecewise, through one shared helper).
   - *Never-panic decoder entry points*: `fuzz_png_decode`,
     `fuzz_jpeg_decode`, `fuzz_tiff_read`, `fuzz_tiff_ifd` (header/IFD chain
     only — cheaper, so it spends its whole budget on the parsing surface),
     `fuzz_image_open` (`oxiarc-image`'s facade, every format tried against
     every input, not just the sniffed one).
   - *Property/limit targets*: `fuzz_http_decode` (arbitrary
     `Content-Encoding` chains and `DecodeLimits`, asserting the decoded
     length never passes `max_output`), `fuzz_http_headers` (every header
     parser, plus `AcceptEncoding::to_header_value` round-tripping through
     this crate's own `parse_accept_encoding`), `fuzz_jpeg_tables`
     (`TableSet::parse`/`emit` idempotence), and `fuzz_png_limits`, which
     installs the peak-tracking global allocator from
     [`support/counting_alloc.rs`](support/counting_alloc.rs) and asserts a
     decode under tight `DecodeLimits` never allocates past a ceiling
     derived from those same limits.

Every target's contract is the same: feed it arbitrary bytes, and the
decoder must return `Ok(..)` or a structured `Err(..)` — it must never
panic, abort, hang, or (for the ASan-instrumented `cargo fuzz build`)
read/write out of bounds. The differential targets add one more: whenever
both sides accept an input, their output must be byte-identical. Each one
bounds its own driving loop with a `CALL_GUARD` so a state machine that
stops making progress fails as a crash rather than as a libFuzzer timeout.

## Structured-input targets

A few decoders need more than a raw byte slice — e.g. `oxiarc_lzhuf::decode_lzh`
also takes an `LzhMethod` and a declared uncompressed size, and
`oxiarc_lzw::decompress` also takes an `LzwConfig` and expected size. Those
targets (`fuzz_lzh_decode`, `fuzz_lzw_decompress`, `fuzz_szip_decode`) use
`arbitrary::Unstructured` to peel a handful of header bytes off the front of
the fuzz input to synthesize those parameters (with declared sizes capped
to a sane ceiling so a bogus header can't force an unbounded allocation),
then hand the remaining bytes to the decoder as the compressed payload.
