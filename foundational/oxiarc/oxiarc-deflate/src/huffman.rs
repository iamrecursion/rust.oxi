//! Huffman coding for DEFLATE compression.
//!
//! This module implements Huffman tree construction and decoding as specified
//! in RFC 1951. DEFLATE uses canonical Huffman codes, where codes of the same
//! length are assigned consecutive values in lexicographic order.
//!
//! # Alphabets
//!
//! DEFLATE uses three Huffman alphabets:
//! - **Literal/Length**: 0-285 (0-255 literals, 256 EOB, 257-285 lengths)
//! - **Distance**: 0-29 (back-reference distances)
//! - **Code Length**: 0-18 (for encoding dynamic Huffman trees)
