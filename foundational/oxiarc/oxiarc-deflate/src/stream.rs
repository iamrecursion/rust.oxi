//! Resumable raw-DEFLATE (RFC 1951) decoding.
//!
//! [`InflateStream`] is a *push* decoder: every call takes a prefix of the
//! compressed input and fills a prefix of the caller's output buffer, and
//! **all** decoder state — the partially consumed byte in the bit
//! accumulator, a half-parsed dynamic Huffman header, a match that is
//! half-copied — survives across calls. An arbitrary byte split of the same
//! compressed stream therefore produces byte-identical output.
//!
//! This is the piece the rest of the workspace builds on: `WrappedInflate`
//! (gzip/zlib framing), the `Read`/`AsyncRead` adapters, the HTTP
//! content-coding decoders, and the PNG/TIFF image codecs all drive it.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use oxiarc_core::traits::FlushMode;
//! use oxiarc_deflate::{deflate, InflateStatus, InflateStream};
//!
//! let original = b"push decoding, one byte at a time".repeat(64);
//! let compressed = deflate(&original, 6).expect("deflate");
//!
//! // Feed the compressed stream one byte per call into a 16-byte window.
//! let mut stream = InflateStream::new();
//! let mut out = Vec::new();
//! let mut scratch = [0u8; 16];
//! let mut fed = 0usize;
//! loop {
//!     let chunk = compressed.get(fed..(fed + 1).min(compressed.len()))
//!         .unwrap_or_default();
//!     let last = fed + chunk.len() >= compressed.len();
//!     let flush = if last { FlushMode::Finish } else { FlushMode::None };
//!     let p = stream.inflate(chunk, &mut scratch, flush).expect("inflate");
//!     fed += p.consumed;
//!     out.extend_from_slice(&scratch[..p.produced]);
//!     if p.status == InflateStatus::StreamEnd {
//!         break;
//!     }
//! }
//! assert_eq!(out, original);
//! ```
//!
//! # Flush modes
//!
//! `flush` is [`oxiarc_core::traits::FlushMode`]:
//!
//! | Mode | Meaning for the decoder |
//! |---|---|
//! | `None` (default) | More input may follow; running dry yields [`InflateStatus::NeedInput`]. |
//! | `Finish` | This is the last input; running dry before the end of the stream is `UnexpectedEof`. |
//! | `Sync` | As `None`, but return as soon as an empty stored block (an RFC 1951 sync flush) completes. |
//! | `Full`, `Partial` | Treated as `None` — they are encoder-side concepts. |
//!
//! `FlushMode` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so anything not listed above is
//! handled by the same wildcard arm as `Full`/`Partial`.
//!
//! ## Which mode each consumer passes
//!
//! The choice is not a preference: it is fixed by whether the caller can
//! still obtain more input. Passing `None` when no more input exists turns a
//! truncated stream into a silent short read; passing `Finish` when more
//! input *is* coming turns a legal chunk boundary into `UnexpectedEof`.
//!
//! | Consumer | `flush` |
//! |---|---|
//! | TIFF strip / tile (the whole compressed slice is in hand) | `Finish` on the single call |
//! | APNG frame / PNG `fdAT` run (complete slice) | `Finish`, then [`InflateStream::reset`] |
//! | PNG main `IDAT` chain, fed chunk by chunk | `None` until the `IDAT` run ends, then `Finish` |
//! | HTTP response body | `None` until transport EOF, then `Finish` |
//! | `RawInflateReader` (RFC 4978 — the peer may still send more) | `None` **always** |
//! | `Decompressor::decompress` (whole-remaining-input contract) | `Finish` |
//!
//! The `Read`/`AsyncRead` adapters implement the "`None` until EOF, then
//! `Finish`" rule by switching to `Finish` the moment the inner reader
//! returns `Ok(0)`, which is what makes a truncated stream an error rather
//! than a short read.
//!
//! # Limits
//!
//! [`InflateStream::with_max_output`] and
//! [`InflateStream::with_ratio_guard`] are enforced **inside** a block, not
//! merely between blocks: a single dynamic block can legally expand a few
//! hundred kilobytes into hundreds of megabytes, so a between-blocks check
//! is no protection at all. Both bound **one stream** and are cleared by
//! [`InflateStream::reset`]; a container that resets the decoder per frame
//! or per strip (APNG, TIFF) must carry its own file-level budget.
