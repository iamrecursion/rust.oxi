//! Resumable gzip / zlib framing over [`InflateStream`].
//!
//! [`WrappedInflate`] adds RFC 1950 (zlib) and RFC 1952 (gzip) container
//! handling to the raw-DEFLATE core, with the same push API: every header
//! field, every trailer and every multi-member boundary is resumable, so a
//! one-byte-at-a-time feed decodes exactly as a whole-slice feed does.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use oxiarc_core::traits::FlushMode;
//! use oxiarc_deflate::{gzip_compress, InflateStatus, InflateWrapper, WrappedInflate};
//!
//! let compressed = gzip_compress(b"framed payload", 6).expect("gzip");
//! let mut decoder = WrappedInflate::new(InflateWrapper::Gzip);
//! let mut out = [0u8; 64];
//! let progress = decoder
//!     .inflate(&compressed, &mut out, FlushMode::Finish)
//!     .expect("inflate");
//! assert_eq!(progress.status, InflateStatus::StreamEnd);
//! assert_eq!(&out[..progress.produced], b"framed payload");
//! assert_eq!(decoder.members_decoded(), 1);
//! ```
//!
//! # Trailing bytes and the first member
//!
//! Two independent knobs decide what happens around member boundaries, and
//! they are deliberately *not* merged, because real callers need different
//! answers at member 0 and after it:
//!
//! * [`TrailingPolicy`] governs bytes that follow the **last complete
//!   member**: reject them, tolerate `0x00` padding (what the `gzip` CLI and
//!   CPython do), or stop silently at the first byte that does not start
//!   another member.
//! * [`WrappedInflate::strict_first_member`] governs bytes at **offset 0**.
//!   With `true` (the default) a stream that does not begin with a valid
//!   header is an error; with `false` it decodes as an empty stream, which
//!   is what the legacy `GzipStreamDecoder` promises its callers.
//!
//! Checksums follow the same shape: [`WrappedInflate::verify_header_crc`]
//! covers the gzip `FHCRC` field and [`WrappedInflate::verify_checksum`] the
//! trailer (gzip CRC-32 + ISIZE, zlib Adler-32). Both default to `true`.
//! Turning the trailer check off still *consumes* the trailer — the framing
//! stays exact, only the comparison is skipped — which is what PNG needs,
//! since the reference `png` crate ignores IDAT Adler-32 by default.
