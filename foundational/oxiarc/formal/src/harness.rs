//! Harnesses over the **public** `oxiarc` API.
//!
//! Nothing in this file is a copy of `oxiarc`: every target is called through
//! the real crates' public interface (`oxiarc_core::BitCache`,
//! `oxiarc_lz4::xxhash`, `oxiarc_deflate::HuffmanTree`), and `cargo-formal`
//! lowers the reachable bodies of those three crates into the verification
//! condition (28 dependency bodies lowered, 27 of them reachable, plus 2
//! monomorphic instances, in the run recorded in `README.md`). Private
//! helpers (`bulk_load`, `read_u32_le`, `round32`) are verified as inlined
//! callees of the public entry points that reach them, which is the honest
//! scope: a caller can only ever reach them that way.
//!
//! Every entry point states the property it raises and the **measured** L1
//! verdict for it; `EXPECTED.toml` at the package root mirrors the same table
//! machine-readably, and `README.md` names the run that produced it.

//! | [`oxiarc_lz4::xxhash`] one-shot and streaming | 32-bit avalanche chains over attacker bytes | `proved`, `timeout`, `unsupported` |
//! | [`oxiarc_deflate::HuffmanTree`] entry packing and table build | pure bit packing, and a table builder whose symbolic-index write L1 refuses | `proved`, `unsupported` |
//!
//! A decompressor is exactly the kind of code where this matters: all of it
//! runs on attacker-supplied bytes.
