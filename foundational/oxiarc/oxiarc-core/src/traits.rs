/// family of codecs in this workspace. It is an *optional* convenience
/// abstraction, not a requirement placed on every codec crate: algorithms
/// whose native streaming shape does not map cleanly onto this
/// consume/produce/status contract (e.g. block-oriented codecs such as
/// bzip2, or codecs built around a different streaming API) are free to
/// expose their own encoder/decoder types instead of implementing this
/// trait.
///
/// # Contract: `decompress` receives a whole-remaining-input, not a genuine
/// chunk
///
/// `decompress` has no `flush`/`finish` parameter, unlike [`Compressor`]'s
/// [`compress`][Compressor::compress]. That is deliberate, not an oversight:
/// **every call must be handed all of the compressed input still
/// available**, as if it were the final, complete tail of the stream. An
/// implementation is entitled to treat a slice that ends mid-symbol as
/// truncated input and return an error, rather than requesting more input
/// via [`DecompressStatus::NeedsInput`] — a conforming caller has, by
/// definition, nothing more to offer this call. [`decompress_all`] (below)
/// upholds this by construction: it always passes the *entire* unconsumed
/// remainder of `input` on every call, never a deliberately-truncated
/// prefix.
///
/// **This trait is the wrong tool for feeding genuine chunks** — a few
/// kilobytes of an HTTP response body at a time, say, where more bytes are
/// truly still in flight and have not arrived yet. Reaching for
/// `decompress`/`decompress_all` in that situation, then re-driving the same
/// decompressor with each new chunk appended, does not recover the intended
/// semantics: an implementation that honors the contract above is free to
/// error out on the first incomplete chunk instead of waiting. Callers with
/// genuine chunks must use a codec's own push-decoder type instead, where an
/// explicit flush parameter distinguishes "more is coming" from "this is
/// everything" — `oxiarc_deflate`'s `InflateStream`/`WrappedInflate` (or its
/// `InflateReader`/`AsyncInflateReader` adapters, which drive them from a
/// `Read`/`AsyncRead` source), `oxiarc_lz4`'s frame streaming decoder, or
/// `StreamingLzhDecoder`.
///
/// # Contract: no silent, unbounded spinning
///
/// A conforming implementation must make *some* forward progress — consume
/// input, produce output, or transition to
/// [`Done`][DecompressStatus::Done] — on every call that is not already
/// finished; it must never return the same `(0, 0, status)` indefinitely
/// while claiming to still need input or output it can never receive from a
/// whole-remaining-input caller. [`decompress_all`]'s default
/// implementation enforces this from the caller's side as a safety net: two
/// consecutive calls that both consume zero bytes and produce zero bytes
/// (without reaching `Done`) are treated as a stalled decoder and reported
/// as an error, instead of looping forever.

// format defines its own level enum — see `oxiarc_bzip2::CompressionLevel`,
// `ZipCompressionLevel`, `LzhCompressionLevel`, and the CLI's own
// `CompressionLevel` — and `oxiarc_bzip2::CompressionLevel` even collides on
// the name), so keeping an unused, never-implemented "shared" type in core
// would advertise an abstraction nothing honors. Per-codec level types are
// the deliberate, documented design: each compression format has a
// different natural level range/semantics (e.g. 0-9 vs 0-11), and forcing
// them through one shared type would either lose precision or require
// lossy conversions at every call site. If a genuinely shared level
// abstraction is wanted in the future, it should be reintroduced only once
// at least the majority of codecs are prepared to adopt it directly,
// tracked per-crate.
