//! Parallel strip/tile decode and encode through `rayon`.
//!
//! Off by default, so the crate stays wasm32-buildable (wasm32 has no
//! threads) -- see [`crate::Decoder::read_image_parallel`] and
//! [`crate::Encoder::write_image_parallel`].
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Both directions follow the same shape (tiff-design.md P4): the one thing
//! that cannot be parallelised is I/O through a single `Read + Seek` /
//! `Write + Seek` handle, so that step stays serial and cheap; the CPU-bound
//! step -- decompress/predictor/unpack on decode, pack/predictor/compress on
//! encode -- is spread across a `rayon` thread pool, each chunk getting its
//! own scratch buffers so nothing is shared but read-only state.
//!
//! * **Decode**: fetch a *bounded batch* of chunks' compressed bytes serially
//!   (one `Vec<u8>` each), decode the batch in parallel, then place each
//!   decoded chunk into the destination serially (a cheap `memcpy`, and the
//!   only step that touches the shared `dst` buffer); repeat until every
//!   chunk is done.
//! * **Encode**: gather and encode every chunk in parallel into a batch of
//!   compressed payloads, then stream the batch through the writer serially
//!   in order. Unlike the streaming [`crate::ImageWriter`], this holds every
//!   chunk's compressed payload in memory at once (O(image) instead of
//!   O(chunk)) -- the price of being able to compress out of order.
//!
//! # Why the decode batch is bounded
//!
//! The serial decode pipeline holds exactly one chunk's compressed bytes at a
//! time, in a buffer whose size [`crate::Limits::intermediate_buffer_size`]
//! caps. A parallel driver that fetched *every* chunk before decoding any of
//! them would hold `chunk_count` of those at once -- and nothing in a TIFF
//! forces distinct strips to occupy distinct bytes: a file whose
//! `StripOffsets` all point at the same region and whose `StripByteCounts`
//! all declare that region's full length costs `chunk_count x count` resident
//! bytes while the file itself stays small. The per-chunk
//! `check_intermediate` guard cannot see that, because it only ever looks at
//! one chunk. `batch_end` therefore closes a batch as soon as the *declared*
//! compressed bytes in it would exceed `intermediate_buffer_size`, so the
//! resident compressed bytes never exceed that cap (a single chunk larger
//! than the cap is already rejected by `check_intermediate`, so the
//! "always take at least one" rule cannot breach it either). Planning from
//! the declared count rather than the fetched one is deliberate: it is the
//! upper bound, and it is known before the read that would allocate.
//!
//! The decoded side needs no separate cap of its own: the whole image's
//! decoded output is precharged against the caller's [`OutputBudget`] before
//! any chunk is fetched, and the destination buffer the chunks are placed
//! into was already sized and checked against
//! [`crate::Limits::max_image_bytes`]. A batch's aggregate *native* bytes can
//! exceed its precharged packed total -- sub-byte depths expand up to 8x on
//! unpacking, and edge tiles are decoded padded -- so the true bound there is
//! a small multiple of `max_image_bytes`, which is the inherent cost of
//! holding a batch of decoded chunks at once rather than one.
//!
//! Both drivers reuse the exact functions the serial path uses for every
//! step that is not "which thread runs this" -- [`crate::decode::decode_fetched_chunk`]
//! and [`crate::decode::chunk_output_len`] on read, and the (crate-private)
//! `writer::image::{encode_chunk_pure, gather_chunk_into,
//! build_shared_jpeg_tables_tag}` on write -- so there is exactly one
//! implementation of what a chunk decodes or encodes to, never a second copy
//! that can drift from the serial one.
//!
//! [`crate::compression::CodecState`] is shared across every worker of one
//! call, and every codec that keeps scratch holds it in a *pool*: a worker
//! takes a decoder out for the length of its chunk and puts it back after, so
//! the lock is held only around the hand-off and no two workers ever touch
//! one decoder. The LZW code-width rule is a lock-free `AtomicU8`.
//!
//! # When parallel decode is worth it (measured, not assumed)
//!
//! The win is whatever CPU cost a chunk's *decompress* step carries; the
//! serial fetch pass, the `memcpy` placement and the thread-pool dispatch are
//! overhead added on top. So this feature is **not** a uniform win, and it is
//! not even purely a property of the codec: PackBits over incompressible data
//! is nearly a byte copy, while the same codec over long literal runs has
//! real expansion work to do.
//!
//! Interleaved A/B (serial and parallel timed in the same loop), 4096x4096,
//! medians of nine rounds, release build, 8 cores. The first block was
//! measured at load average 6-10, the second at 33-46 (this machine is
//! shared), so the two are not directly comparable with each other -- only
//! each arm with the other arm of its own row, which is what interleaving is
//! for.
//!
//! | Fixture | Serial | Parallel | Ratio |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | LZW, 256x256 tiles, incompressible | 114 ms | 32 ms | **3.6x faster** |
//! | LZW, 256x256 tiles, compressible | 26.6 ms | 10.4 ms | **2.6x faster** |
//! | PackBits, 256x256 tiles, compressible | 2.6 ms | 2.4 ms | 1.09x |
//! | PackBits, 256x256 tiles, incompressible | 3.8 ms | 4.2 ms | 0.90x |
//! | uncompressed, 64-row strips | 2.1 ms | 3.1 ms | **0.66x, slower** |
//!
//! The four codecs that keep pooled scratch, 32-row strips, remeasured after
//! the pools replaced the single-slot caches:
//!
//! | Fixture | Serial | Parallel | Ratio |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Deflate, Gray8 | 77.7 ms | 34.6 ms | **2.24x faster** |
//! | LZW, Gray8 | 166.4 ms | 78.2 ms | **2.13x faster** |
//! | Group 4, bilevel | 81.9 ms | 27.0 ms | **3.04x faster** |
//! | Group 3 2D, bilevel | 69.0 ms | 34.0 ms | **2.03x faster** |
//!
//! Read that as two groups rather than nine numbers:
//!
//! * **Worth it**: every codec whose per-chunk decompress is real CPU work --
//!   Deflate, LZW, both fax codecs measured here, and ZSTD, LZMA and JPEG by
//!   the same argument. Deflate used to sit at 0.98x, and the fax codecs had
//!   no gain at all, because a single cached decoder behind a `Mutex` made
//!   the workers queue for the codec; pooling the decoders is what turned
//!   those rows into 2-3x. LZW came out faster in every run, including a
//!   repeat at load average 30 on 8 cores where it still managed 1.3x.
//! * **No reliable gain, sometimes a loss**: uncompressed, and PackBits.
//!   These are `memcpy`-bound, so the overhead is a large fraction of the
//!   total; repeated runs straddled 1.0 (0.32x to 1.12x for PackBits,
//!   depending on how compressible the data was and how many cores were
//!   free). Prefer [`crate::Decoder::read_image`] for these.
//!
//! Absolute times and the size of the win move with machine load -- the
//! parallel arm needs free cores and the serial arm does not, so a busy box
//! penalises it even in an interleaved measurement. Only the LZW direction
//! held under every load tested. Encode is the easier direction: every chunk's
//! compression is independent CPU work with no shared lock, so it
//! parallelises for every codec.
