//! UNIX `compress(1)` / `.Z` container support (`Content-Encoding: compress`).
//!
//! `.Z` is the LZW variant produced by 4.3BSD `compress`, `ncompress` and
//! `gzip -Z`, and the coding HTTP calls `compress` / `x-compress`
//! (RFC 9110 §8.4.1.1). It is *not* TIFF LZW and *not* GIF LZW: it has its
//! own container header, its own code-width ceiling, its own table-reset
//! rule and its own bit-packing quirk, which is why it lives in a module of
//! its own instead of being another [`crate::LzwConfig`].
//!
//! # The format
//!
//! ```text
//! byte 0   0x1F  ┐ magic
//! byte 1   0x9D  ┘
//! byte 2   bit 7    block mode (code 256 resets the table)
//!          bits 5-6 reserved (ignored)
//!          bits 0-4 max_bits, 9..=16
//! byte 3.. LSB-first codes, 9 bits wide at first
//! ```
//!
//! * **No end-of-information code.** Decoding ends when the input does, so
//!   a truncated `.Z` decodes to a *prefix* and is not reported as an
//!   error. Both `gzip -dc` and `uncompress -c` behave this way; there is no
//!   in-band way to tell a truncated stream from a complete one.
//! * **Codes are written in groups of eight**, i.e. `n_bits` bytes at a
//!   time. When the table outgrows the current width, or when block mode
//!   resets it, the writer pads the current group out to eight codes and
//!   the reader skips the same padding. Get this wrong and streams decode
//!   correctly right up to the first width change.
//! * **Block mode** (every `compress(1)` in circulation sets it) makes code
//!   256 a table reset. The writer restarts allocation at 257; the reader
//!   restarts at 256 and burns that slot on the next code, which is what
//!   keeps the two in step. Without block mode, 256 is an ordinary entry.
//! * **The first code of a stream must be a literal byte**, in either mode.
//!   A leading CLEAR is [`crate::LzwError::InvalidCode`]`(256)`, not a reset
//!   of an already-initial table. No `compress(1)` writes one, and the
//!   reference decoders split three ways on it:
//!
//!   - GNU `gzip`'s `unlzw.c` and `ncompress` refuse it as corrupt input:
//!     their `oldcode == -1` guard runs *before* the CLEAR handling
//!     (`if (256 <= code) gzip_error("corrupt input.")` in `gzip`);
//!   - the FreeBSD/NetBSD `gzip`'s `zuncompress.c` — Apple's `gzip` on
//!     macOS — applies the CLEAR handling to every code, the first
//!     included, so it reads a reset of the initial table;
//!   - 4.4BSD `compress`'s `zopen.c` — the `uncompress` of FreeBSD and
//!     macOS — outputs the first code unchecked, as its low byte, and then
//!     reads the group padding after it as literals.
//!
//!   This crate follows GNU `gzip`, the strictest of the three. Verified
//!   against gzip 1.14 on GNU/Linux, which answers
//!   `gzip: <name>.Z: corrupt input.` and writes no output (`uncompress`
//!   there is a link to `gunzip`, so it says the same), and on macOS, where
//!   Apple gzip 479 decodes the body after the CLEAR as if the CLEAR were
//!   absent, and the system `uncompress` prints the CLEAR and its seven
//!   padding codes as NUL bytes, the body's literals as themselves and
//!   table garbage for its first table reference — both exiting 0.
//!   `tests/z_oracle.rs` re-checks whichever of these tools is on `PATH`.
//!   The two readings that accept such a stream do not agree with each
//!   other, so rejecting it costs no real stream and keeps crafted input
//!   off a decode path whose output would depend on which decoder happened
//!   to read it.
//! * **`max_bits` is a table ceiling, not a code-width ceiling.** The
//!   reference widens the code as soon as `free_ent > maxcode`, and at
//!   `max_bits == 9` that check fires once more than it "should", so
//!   `compress -b 9` writes some **10-bit** codes (pinned by the
//!   CLI-produced `tests/data/z/widths_b09.Z`). A decoder therefore has to
//!   treat any code from `max_bits` upwards as corrupt input rather than as
//!   a table index — see [`crate::LzwError::InvalidCode`].
//! * **`max_bits` 9-16.** 12 is the TIFF/GIF ceiling; `compress` defaults to
//!   16. At that width the decoder's code table is about 193 KiB (a
//!   `prefix`/`suffix` pair over 65 536 entries) and the encoder's
//!   `(prefix, byte) -> code` index is about 768 KiB; both are measured by
//!   `tests/z_memory.rs`. The decoder's table is sized from the *header*, so
//!   a four-byte file can ask for the 16-bit one: the output limits below
//!   bound *output*, not table memory (this is the reference
//!   implementations' cost too).
//!
//! # Entry points

//! | | one-shot | streaming |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | decode | [`decompress`], [`decompress_with_limit`], [`decompress_into`] | [`ZReader`] |
//! | encode | [`compress`], [`compress_with_block_mode`] | [`ZWriter`] |
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use oxiarc_lzw::z::{ZHeader, compress, decompress, decompress_with_limit};
//!
//! let original = b"UNIX compress round trip. ".repeat(64);
//! let stream = compress(&original, 16).expect("compress");
//!
//! // A real `.Z` file: `uncompress -c` and `gzip -dc` both accept this.
//! assert_eq!(&stream[..2], &[0x1F, 0x9D]);
//! assert_eq!(ZHeader::parse(&stream).expect("header").max_bits, 16);
//!
//! assert_eq!(decompress(&stream).expect("decompress"), original);
//!
//! // Untrusted input: bound the output, enforced while decoding.
//! assert!(decompress_with_limit(&stream, 8).is_err());
//! ```
//!
//! # Interoperability
//!
//! [`compress`] is byte-identical to `compress -b N -c` — not merely
//! decodable by it — for every width 9..=16 across the payload shapes in
//! `tests/z_oracle.rs`, and the decoder reproduces real `compress` output
//! byte for byte in the other direction. Two deliberate departures from the
//! reference C code:
//!
//! * on a **truncated** stream the reference decoders can emit one extra
//!   bogus code, because their final short read leaves the tail of a fixed
//!   `n_bits`-byte buffer holding the previous group; this decoder stops at
//!   the last code that lies wholly inside the data;
//! * **empty input** produces the three-byte header here (as `ncompress`
//!   does), where the `compress` on some platforms writes a zero-byte file
//!   that is not a `.Z` stream at all.
