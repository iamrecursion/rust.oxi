//! Parallel entropy decoding across restart intervals (`rayon` feature).
//!
//! A restart marker is a hard synchronisation point: T.81 E.2.4 resets the
//! predictions, the bit (or arithmetic) accumulator and — for arithmetic —
//! every statistics area, so the data between two markers can be decoded
//! knowing nothing about what came before it. That makes restart intervals
//! the one place a JPEG scan is embarrassingly parallel.
//!
//! # What is parallelised, and what is not
//!
//! Only a **sequential** scan (`SOF0`, `SOF1`, `SOF9`) of a frame that
//! carries restart markers, and only when the interval tiles whole MCU rows
//! — otherwise two bands would write into the same sample row and the merge
//! would need locking for no gain. Progressive and lossless scans stay
//! serial: a progressive frame revisits every block in later scans, and
//! lossless prediction crosses restart intervals row by row.
//!
//! The output is **identical** either way. `tests/parallel.rs` asserts that
//! two ways: by running both paths over the same input, and — because two
//! runs in one process share a configuration — against digests of the encoded
//! bytes *and* of the decoded samples that were measured in a build without
//! this feature and are asserted in builds with and without it.
