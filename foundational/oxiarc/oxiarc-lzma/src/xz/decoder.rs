//! A reusable `.xz` decoder context.
//!
//! [`decompress_into`](super::decompress_into) is a thin one-shot wrapper:
//! every call parses a fresh [`XzReader`], which starts with an empty LZMA2
//! decoder cache and therefore builds its dictionary (window) buffer from
//! nothing. That is the right default for decoding a handful of streams,
//! but some callers decode many streams in a tight loop that all share the
//! same LZMA2 dictionary size — the motivating case is TIFF
//! `Compression = 34925`, where every strip or tile of one image is its own
//! complete `.xz` stream, and a large image can have thousands of them.
//! Rebuilding a multi-megabyte dictionary buffer (growing it one
//! `Vec::push` at a time from empty) thousands of times over is pure waste
//! when the buffer could simply be kept and overwritten in place.
//!
//! [`XzDecoder`] is that reusable context: construct one, call
//! [`XzDecoder::decompress_into`] once per stream, and the LZMA2 decoder
//! (dictionary buffer, probability model, coder state) it built for the
//! first stream is kept and reused for the next one, as long as that next
//! stream declares the same dictionary size — which repeated calls from one
//! caller almost always do, since it comes from the encoder's settings, not
//! the data. A stream that declares a different dictionary size still
//! decodes correctly; it just pays for a fresh allocation, exactly like
//! today's one-shot [`decompress_into`](super::decompress_into) always does.
