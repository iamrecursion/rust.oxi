//! [`Decoder`]: the push-style response-body decoder, and [`decode_body`],
//! the one-shot convenience over it.
//!
//! # How the bomb guard actually holds
//!
//! Every stage writes through a [`LimitedSink`], and the sink does not
//! *check* the budget after the fact — it **truncates the output slice** the
//! codec is given to whatever is still permitted. `oxiarc-deflate`'s own
//! bounded sink then enforces that same bound on every literal and every
//! match copy, so a single fixed-Huffman DEFLATE block that expands 812 KB
//! into 123 MiB stops after `max_output` bytes, mid-block, having allocated
//! exactly the budget. `tests/limits.rs` regenerates that stream from a
//! committed Rust generator and asserts it.
//!
//! Enforcing the cap between blocks — the obvious design — would materialise
//! all 123 MiB first.
//!
//! # Chained codings
//!
//! RFC 9110 §8.4 lists content codings in the order they were **applied**,
//! so a decoder applies them in reverse: `Content-Encoding: gzip, br` means
//! br was applied last and must be undone first. Each stage owns a fixed
//! 64 KiB buffer feeding the next, so a chain costs bounded memory rather
//! than one fully materialised intermediate body. The common case — exactly
//! one coding — allocates no such buffer at all.
