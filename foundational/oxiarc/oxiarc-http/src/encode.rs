///
/// **[`finish`](Self::finish) is mandatory**: dropping an `Encoder` without

///
/// # Framing, [`flush`](std::io::Write::flush), and the zstd multi-frame rule
///
/// The dispatch is uniform; the *framing* underneath it is not, because each
/// wrapped encoder has its own idea of what an incremental boundary is. This
/// matters for what a peer needs in order to decode the result, so it is
/// spelled out rather than left to the sibling crates' docs:
///
/// | Coding | What `flush()` emits | Resulting stream |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `identity` | nothing of its own; flushes `W` | the bytes as written |
/// | `gzip` | a DEFLATE sync flush inside the **same** gzip member (~5 bytes) | one gzip member |
/// | `deflate` | a DEFLATE sync flush inside the **same** zlib stream | one zlib stream |
/// | `br` | every complete meta-block; a ≤7-bit residue can stay buffered until the next block or `finish` | one brotli stream |
/// | `zstd` / `dcz` | a **complete Zstandard frame** | a *sequence* of frames |
/// | `compress` | nothing extra; `ZWriter` batches internally (~32 KiB) regardless of `flush()` | one `.Z` stream |
/// | `dcb` | — | **not buildable**: [`Encoder::new`] refuses it (see that arm's doc comment); use [`encode_body`] |
///
/// `dcz`'s row covers only the frame *after* [`new`](Self::new)'s one-time,
/// synchronous 40-byte write of the RFC 9842 preamble — that part is neither
/// buffered nor affected by `flush()`, since it goes to `writer` before this
/// `Encoder` exists at all.
///
/// So for gzip, deflate and brotli, `flush()` is cheap and invisible to the
/// peer — the output is still one member/stream, and a plain one-shot
/// decoder handles it.
///
/// **Zstd is different, and it is not only about `flush`.**
/// `oxiarc_zstd::ZstdStreamEncoder` closes a frame every `flush()` *and*
/// automatically every 128 KiB of buffered input, so **any** body that is
/// streamed in chunks past that boundary — no explicit `flush()` required —
/// comes out as several concatenated frames. That is a perfectly legal
/// Zstandard stream (RFC 8878 §3: "multiple frames can be appended"), and it
/// is what makes bounded-memory zstd streaming possible at all, but the peer
/// must use a **multi-frame-capable** decoder. A single-frame entry point
/// stops after the first frame: `oxiarc_zstd::decompress` on such a body
/// returns `Ok` with only the first frame's bytes — a *silent truncation*,
/// not an error. Decode with `oxiarc_zstd::decompress_multi_frame` (or
/// `decompress_multi_frame_with_dict` for the frame after a `dcz` preamble),
/// or, in this crate, [`Decoder`](crate::Decoder) — which is multi-frame
/// aware by construction — never with the single-frame one.
///
/// [`encode_body`] does **not** have this property: it compresses in one
/// shot and always emits exactly one frame. If a single-frame body matters
/// more than bounded memory, use it instead of `Encoder`.
///
/// Every non-identity variant boxes its inner encoder: with only one codec
/// feature enabled, `Identity(W)` (as small as `W` itself) would otherwise
