//! Shared (custom) LZ77 dictionaries.
//!
//! A *shared dictionary* is a block of bytes both peers already have. Attaching
//! one lets a stream's backward references reach into it, so a small response
//! can be coded almost entirely as references into content the client already
//! holds. This is the mechanism behind `Content-Encoding: dcb`
//! (dictionary-compressed Brotli, RFC 9842) and behind the reference
//! `brotli --dictionary=FILE` / `-D FILE` command-line option.
//!
//! It is **not** the RFC 7932 Appendix A static dictionary, which is built into
//! every Brotli implementation and stays available whether or not a shared
//! dictionary is attached (see [`crate::dictionary`]). The two live in adjacent
//! ranges of the same distance space, and `classify_distance` below (crate-
//! internal) is the single place that splits them.
//!
//! # Distance space
//!
//! With `max_backward = min(window_size, bytes_produced)` and a shared
//! dictionary of `dict_len` bytes, a decoded distance `d` means:
//!
//! | range | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `1 ..= max_backward` | ordinary backward reference into the produced output |
//! | `max_backward + 1 ..= max_backward + dict_len` | shared dictionary, at offset `dict_len - (d - max_backward)` |
//! | `> max_backward + dict_len` | Appendix A static dictionary, word id `d - max_backward - dict_len - 1` |
//!
//! Two consequences are worth stating because they are easy to get wrong:
//!
//! * the shared dictionary is addressed **relative to `max_backward`**, not to
//!   a fixed virtual position, so the same dictionary byte has a different
//!   distance code at different output positions until `max_backward`
//!   saturates at the window size;
//! * because `max_backward` is capped by the window but the dictionary range
//!   sits *beyond* it, a shared dictionary stays reachable no matter how much
//!   output has been produced, and its distances legitimately exceed the
//!   declared window.
//!
//! Both were established by measurement against `brotli 1.1.0`, not assumed: a
//! 1.1 MB dictionary attached to a stream declaring `lgwin = 10` (a 1008-byte
//! window) codes a 4 KiB copy from the *start* of that dictionary in 18 bytes,
//! and the distance the reference encoder emits for it is
//! `max_backward + dict_len - offset` (observed 1,100,986 for
//! `max_backward = 1008`, `dict_len = 1,100,000`, `offset = 22`), not
//! `produced + dict_len - offset`. The same stream still reaches the dictionary
//! after 200,000 bytes of output.
//!
//! # A copy may not leave the dictionary
//!
//! A shared-dictionary reference may take at most the bytes from its source to
//! the *end* of the dictionary. A copy longer than that is a format error, not
//! a copy that continues in the produced output: the dictionary is a compound
//! history block, not a prefix glued in front of the sliding window.
//!
//! That too is measured rather than assumed. Two hand-built streams differing
//! in exactly one field — the copy length of a single command reading the
//! dictionary's last four bytes — go to `brotli 1.1.0 -d -D`: the one that
//! stops at the dictionary's end is accepted and reproduces this crate's bytes,
//! and the ones that would run 1, 6 or 18 bytes past it are all rejected as
//! "corrupt input", at both a 1008-byte and a 65520-byte declared window. The
//! pair is re-run as `brotli_oracle.rs::
//! test_oracle_reference_rejects_a_copy_past_the_dictionary_end`, so the rule
//! is re-derived from the reference on every oracle run rather than frozen into
//! a comment.
//!
//! Both of this crate's decoders enforce it at the point the distance is
//! resolved, before a byte of the copy is produced, so the one-shot and the
//! incremental decoder reject the same streams with the same error whatever
//! output-buffer size the caller supplies.
//!
//! The literal context bytes `p1`/`p2` are **not** seeded from the dictionary:
//! at output position 0 they are zero even with a dictionary attached. That too
//! is measured — the reference encoder emits byte-identical output for 37
//! dictionaries differing only in their last two bytes.
