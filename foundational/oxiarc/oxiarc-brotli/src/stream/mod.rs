//! Bounded, truly incremental Brotli decoding.
//!
//! [`BrotliStream`] is a *push* decoder: you hand it whatever compressed bytes
//! you have and whatever output space you have, and it makes as much progress
//! as both allow. It never buffers the whole compressed input, never
//! materialises the whole decompressed output, and never needs the stream to
//! arrive in any particular chunking — feeding one byte at a time into a
//! one-byte output slice produces exactly the same bytes as one call with
//! everything.
//!
//! This is what [`crate::decompress()`] cannot do: that decoder borrows a
//! complete `&[u8]`, resolves backward references against the growing output
//! `Vec`, and has no way to say "I need more input" as distinct from "this
//! stream is truncated". [`BrotliStream`] is built for HTTP bodies, pipes and
//! any other source that arrives in pieces.
//!
//! # Memory
//!
//! Peak memory is `O(window)`, not `O(stream)`:
//!
//! * a sliding-window ring of at most `1 << WBITS` bytes, allocated lazily and
//!   grown on demand, so a 40-byte stream that declares `lgwin = 22` costs
//!   4 KiB rather than 4 MiB. Refuse over-large windows *before* allocation
//!   with [`BrotliStream::with_max_window`] (default 16 MiB, which admits every
//!   RFC 7932 window including `WBITS = 24`);
//! * one meta-block's prefix codes and context maps, replaced per meta-block;
//! * a small input carry, described below.
//!
//! [`BrotliStream::with_max_output`] additionally caps the *total* output.
//! Because every meta-block declares its exact `MLEN`, the check runs before
//! the offending meta-block is decoded — so a decompression bomb is refused
//! without any of its expansion being produced.
//!
//! # The input carry
//!
//! A meta-block prelude (up to 256 prefix codes per category plus two context
//! maps) is parsed atomically: the bit cursor is rewound and the prelude
//! re-parsed when it does not fit in the bytes received so far. Those bytes
//! are therefore held in an internal carry until the prelude completes. The
//! carry is compacted in place (never `remove(0)`), and is bounded by
//! `MAX_METABLOCK_HEADER` (1 MiB) — a prelude that does not complete within it
//! is corruption, not slow input. Inside the command loop the carry drains
//! down to a few bytes, because every command is individually rewindable.
//!
//! Bytes are consumed exactly once: [`BrotliStream::decode`] reports every
//! input byte it took as `consumed`, and never asks for it again.
//!
//! # Strictness
//!
//! The stream is as strict as the one-shot decoder, and rejects the same
//! things with the same error variants: truncation, non-zero padding,
//! incomplete prefix codes, invalid distances, meta-block length overruns —
//! and, per RFC 7932, any trailing byte after the final meta-block (Brotli
//! defines no stream concatenation). The first error latches: every later call
//! returns it rather than resuming from a half-decoded state.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use oxiarc_brotli::{compress, BrotliStream, BrotliStatus};
//! use oxiarc_core::traits::FlushMode;
//!
//! let original = b"streaming brotli, one byte at a time".repeat(64);
//! let compressed = compress(&original, 5).expect("compress");
//!
//! let mut stream = BrotliStream::new().with_max_output(1 << 20);
//! let mut decoded = Vec::new();
//! let mut out = [0u8; 7];
//! let mut fed = 0;
//!
//! loop {
//!     // One compressed byte in, at most seven decompressed bytes out.
//!     let chunk = &compressed[fed..(fed + 1).min(compressed.len())];
//!     let flush = if fed >= compressed.len() { FlushMode::Finish } else { FlushMode::None };
//!     let progress = stream.decode(chunk, &mut out, flush).expect("decode");
//!     fed += progress.consumed;
//!     decoded.extend_from_slice(&out[..progress.produced]);
//!     if progress.status == BrotliStatus::StreamEnd {
//!         break;
//!     }
//! }
//! stream.finish().expect("complete stream");
//! assert_eq!(decoded, original);
//! ```
