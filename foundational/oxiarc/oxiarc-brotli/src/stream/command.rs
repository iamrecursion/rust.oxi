//! The resumable command loop of the incremental decoder (tier 2).
//!
//! RFC 7932 Section 9.3's command loop is where a Brotli meta-block actually
//! produces bytes: an insert-and-copy symbol, then `insert_length` literals,
//! then a backward reference of `copy_length` bytes (or a static-dictionary
//! word). Three things can interrupt it:
//!
//! 1. **input runs out mid-symbol** — the bit cursor and the block-switch
//!    state are rewound to the start of the step and
//!    [`CommandStatus::NeedInput`] is returned, so no bit is ever consumed
//!    twice and no half-decoded symbol is observable;
//! 2. **the caller's output slice fills up mid-insert, mid-copy or
//!    mid-dictionary-word** — the remaining count is kept in [`CmdState`] and
//!    [`CommandStatus::NeedOutput`] is returned;
//! 3. **the meta-block completes** — [`CommandStatus::Finished`].
//!
//! Rewinding is only ever done *before* a byte is produced. Once a byte has
//! been handed to the caller it is final, which is why the loop is split into
//! a bit-consuming step (rewindable) and a byte-producing step (resumable by
//! count, consuming no bits).
