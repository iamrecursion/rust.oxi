//! Canonical LZH/LHA compression (`-lh4-`/`-lh5-`/`-lh6-`/`-lh7-`).
//!
//! This is the exact inverse of `decode.rs` / `huffman.rs`, which were
//! translated from the reference `lhasa` decoder (`fragglet/lhasa`,
//! `lib/lh_new_decoder.c`, `lib/tree_decode.c`, `lib/bit_stream_reader.c`).
//! Bits are written **most-significant-bit-first** via
//! [`oxiarc_core::MsbBitWriter`] — the opposite of DEFLATE's LSB-first
//! packing, and of this crate's own former (non-canonical) LZH format, which
//! bit-reversed every Huffman code to fake MSB semantics on top of an
//! LSB-first writer. No bit reversal remains anywhere in this path.
//!
//! # Canonical format specification (verified against lhasa source)
//!
//! ## Block structure
//!
//! The compressed stream is a sequence of **blocks**, read/written until the
//! expected uncompressed byte count has been produced. Each block is:
//!
//! ```text
//! [16-bit command count] [temp table] [code table] [offset table] [commands...]
//! ```
//!
//! The 16-bit field is a **count of commands** (literal bytes *or* copy
//! operations), **not** a byte count — a block of `N` long copies can cover far
//! more than `N` output bytes. (The prior format treated this field as a byte
//! count; that is a divergence from canonical, fixed here.) The three tables
//! are always present, in this exact order, even when one or more of them is
//! empty/degenerate — a reader unconditionally parses all three before the
//! first command.
//!
//! Each **command** is one C-tree symbol:
//! * `0..256`: a literal byte value.
//! * `256..NC`: a copy of `symbol - 256 + 3` bytes (minimum match length 3)
//!   from a distance given by the offset tree (below).
//!
//! ## The three per-block tables
//!
//! 1. **Temp table** (a.k.a. PT-tree, ≤ 31 symbols, `TEMP_CODE_BITS = 5`):
//!    used only to Huffman-decode the *code table*'s length list (§2). Format:
//!    `n` (5 bits); if `n == 0`, a single fixed symbol follows (5 bits) and the
//!    table is degenerate (every decode consumes 0 bits and returns that
//!    symbol). Otherwise, `n` code lengths follow, each raw-encoded as a
//!    ["length value"](#length-value-encoding), with one extra wrinkle: right
//!    after the length of **temp-table index 2** is written, a 2-bit field
//!    gives a count (0-3) of how many of the *following* temp-table indices
//!    (3, 4, 5) are skipped (implicitly length 0, no `length value` sent for
//!    them). This encoder always emits `0` here — skip is never used, which
//!    is always valid since a conformant decoder accepts any 0-3 value — but a
//!    decoder must still implement it to read third-party archives.
//!
//! 2. **Code table** (C-tree, `NC = 510` symbols, 9-bit count field): `n` (9
//!    bits); if `n == 0`, a single fixed symbol follows directly (9 bits, temp
//!    table not consulted). Otherwise, `n` code lengths are Huffman-decoded
//!    *through the temp tree*: each decoded temp-symbol `v` means:
//!    * `v == 0`: one code length of 0 (a 1-position skip).
//!    * `v == 1`: `get_bits(4) + 3` zero-length positions (a 3-18 skip).
//!    * `v == 2`: `get_bits(9) + 20` zero-length positions (a 20+ skip).
//!    * `v >= 3`: exactly one code length, value `v - 2`.
//!
//!    A skip only ever *advances the position counter*; it carries no length
//!    value of its own (those positions are 0/unused). Zero-run counts of
//!    exactly **2** and **19** have no single matching primitive (available
//!    primitives are 1, 3..=18, and 20..=531) and must be split across two
//!    consecutive skip instructions (e.g. 19 = an 18-run + a 1-run); this
//!    encoder's `c_length_program` greedily packs the largest usable
//!    primitive first, which naturally produces exactly that decomposition
//!    with no special-casing required.
//!
//!    **Divergence fixed here:** the prior format used temp-symbol `v - 3` as
//!    the code length (reserving `v == 3` as an always-unused "skip" slot that
//!    does not exist in the real format) instead of the canonical `v - 2`, and
//!    conflated the code table's zero-run mechanism with the temp table's
//!    unrelated index-2 skip-count field. They are two independent mechanisms
//!    operating at different structural levels; see [`huffman`](crate::huffman)
//!    module docs.
//!
//! 3. **Offset table** (P-tree, up to `(1 << offset_bits) - 1` symbols; 4 bits
//!    for `-lh4-`/`-lh5-`, 5 bits for `-lh6-`/`-lh7-`): `n` (count-field width
//!    bits); if `n == 0`, a single fixed symbol follows (count-field width
//!    bits). Otherwise, `n` code lengths follow, each raw-encoded as a
//!    ["length value"](#length-value-encoding) — no skip mechanism at all, one
//!    length per symbol unconditionally.
//!
//! ### Length-value encoding
//!
//! Shared by the temp table and offset table's own length lists (**not** used
//! for the code table, which is Huffman-coded instead — see above): 3 bits; if
//! the value is `7`, extended by unary `1`-bits terminated by a `0`-bit (e.g.
//! `7,1,1,0` reads as length `9`).
//!
//! ## Huffman canonicalization
//!
//! Given a set of per-symbol code lengths, codes are assigned in the standard
//! canonical order: process lengths from shortest to longest; within a length,
//! assign consecutive code values to symbols in ascending symbol-index order
//! (the textbook `bl_count`/`next_code` algorithm, identical to DEFLATE's).
//! [`huffman::LzhHuffmanTree::from_code_lengths`](crate::huffman::LzhHuffmanTree::from_code_lengths)
//! builds the matching decode tree directly from lengths (lhasa's
//! `build_tree`), so any correct canonical length assignment — this encoder
//! reuses a standard greedy Huffman-merge plus Kraft-based length limiting —
//! decodes correctly; the specific length-assignment algorithm is an encoder
//! implementation freedom, not part of the wire format.
//!
//! ## Position/distance encoding
//!
//! **Divergence fixed here:** the prior format encoded a match distance `d`
//! (1-based; `d == 1` means "the immediately preceding byte") as `p =
//! floor(log2(d))` extra-bit count with `d == (1 << p) + extra`. Canonical LHA
//! instead classifies `offset = d - 1` (0-based) by its **bit length**:
//!
//! * `offset == 0` (i.e. `d == 1`) → offset-tree symbol `0`, zero extra bits.
//! * `offset == 1` (i.e. `d == 2`) → offset-tree symbol `1`, zero extra bits.
//! * otherwise → symbol `bits = 32 - offset.leading_zeros()` (the bit length
//!   of `offset`, `>= 2`), followed by `bits - 1` extra bits holding `offset -
//!   (1 << (bits - 1))`.
//!
//! See `encode_offset` (the precise inverse of `decode::LzhDecoder`'s
//! `decode_offset`) and [`decode`](crate::decode) module docs.
//!
//! Per-method `offset_bits`/history-buffer sizing lives in
//! [`methods::LzhMethod`](crate::methods::LzhMethod) (`offset_bits`,
//! `history_bits`, `max_offset_codes`), verified against the lhasa
//! `lh{5,6,7}_decoder.c` wrappers. The LZSS match-finder's window size
//! (`LzhMethod::window_size`) is intentionally left smaller than the
//! canonical history-ring size in some cases (e.g. lh5: 8192-byte match
//! window vs. a 16384-byte canonical ring) — this is safe (any distance the
//! encoder can produce is always well within the decoder's larger ring) and
//! deliberately unchanged, since only the distance-to-symbol *convention* was
//! wrong, not the match-finding algorithm itself.
