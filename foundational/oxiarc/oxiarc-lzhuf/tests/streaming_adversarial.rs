//! Adversarial robustness tests for [`StreamingLzhDecoder`] driven purely
//! through the public API.
//!
//! These pin the two properties a streaming decoder handed untrusted bytes
//! must have: it always terminates (no spin, no hang) and it never claims a
//! truncated or corrupted stream decoded completely. They live in an
//! integration test rather than in `src/streaming/decoder.rs` so that file
//! stays well inside the workspace's file-length budget.
