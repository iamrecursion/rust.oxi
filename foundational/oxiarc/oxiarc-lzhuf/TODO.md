## Future Enhancements

### Additional Methods
- [x] lh1 (LZHUF: 4 KB window + adaptive Huffman) — decoder and spec-conformant greedy encoder (done 2026-07-06)
- [x] lh2, lh3 (LHarc 2.x legacy methods) — done 2026-08-04. `-lh2-` is an 8 KiB
  LZSS with the `dhuf.c` adaptive Huffman (flat frequency-sorted node array,
  equal-frequency blocks, a position tree that grows one 64-distance group per
  64 output bytes); `-lh3-` is the same window with `shuf.c` block-static
  tables (16-bit block size, 286 x 1+4-bit literal/length lengths, optional
  128 x 4-bit position table, both with the three-1-lengths degenerate escape,
  plus LArc's built-in `ready_made` fallback table). Decode **and** encode.
  **Verification:** neither Lhasa nor `delharc` implements these two, so there
  is no oracle on PATH. Conformance was established against the canonical LHa
  `dhuf.c`/`shuf.c` decode path compiled standalone (10 payloads x 2 methods =
  20 streams, all byte-identical; a further 10 with the `ready_made` position
  table forced). Five payloads x 2 methods are frozen into
  `tests/lzh_legacy_vectors.rs` so the in-repo gate stays hermetic — see that
  file's header for how to refresh them.
- [x] lzs (LZSS without Huffman) — done 2026-08-04, decode + encode. 2 KiB
  space-filled ring, 11-bit **absolute** history index + 4-bit length biased
  by 2. Gated by the real `lha` CLI (`oxiarc-archive`'s `lha-oracle`).
- [x] lz4, lz5 (LArc LZ methods) — done 2026-08-04. `-lz4-` is stored (the
  reference decoders route it to a null decoder) and now decodes/encodes as
  such instead of being reported unknown; `-lz5-` is a byte-oriented LZSS with
  an LSB-first bitmap byte per eight commands, a 12-bit absolute index and a
  4-bit length biased by 3, over a 4 KiB history pre-seeded with LArc's run/
  ramp/padding image. Both gated by the real `lha` CLI.
- [x] pm0 (PMarc stored) — done 2026-08-04, decode + encode, `lha`-gated.
- [ ] pm1, pm2 (PMarc compressed) — **deferred, format-spec gap.** Unlike every
  other method here, PMarc's compressed variants have no published format
  description; the only specification is Lhasa's `pm2_decoder.c`/`pm1_decoder.c`
  themselves, which are GPL-2.0 and therefore cannot be ported into this
  Apache-2.0/MIT crate. The algorithm is also substantially larger than the
  others (a 5-tree scheme with its own history-copy state machine and an
  8-entry LRU of recent match offsets). Reimplementing it would require a
  clean-room derivation from observed behaviour, since `lha` can decode `-pm2-`
  but cannot create it — leaving no way to generate the fixtures a clean-room
  effort would need. Entries using pm1/pm2 remain listed with a typed
  `unsupported_method` error at extraction time, never a silent mis-decode.

### Performance
- [x] Better hash function — 4-byte multiplicative hash with improved avalanche (done 2026-05-16)
- [x] Optimal parsing for compression — LzssOptimalParser two-pass DP with Huffman cost retraining + LzhEncoder::with_optimal() (done 2026-05-16)
- [ ] SIMD-accelerated matching
- [x] Parallel compression (done 2026-05-17)
  - `parallel` Cargo feature delivering `lzh_compress_parallel`: multi-entry LHA archive builder where each entry's LZSS+Huffman compression runs in a separate rayon worker. Output is a valid LHA archive decodable by any LHA reader.
  - **Files:** NEW `oxiarc-lzhuf/src/parallel.rs`; MODIFIED `Cargo.toml` (parallel = ["dep:rayon"]), `lib.rs`
  - **Tests (7):** `parallel_basic`, `parallel_determinism`, `parallel_methods`, `parallel_single_entry`, `parallel_empty_archive`, `parallel_builder_api`, `parallel_overlong_filename_error`
  - **Key design:** mtime=0 for determinism; no Lh0 fallback; level-1 header format

### Features
- [x] Streaming decompression (done 2026-05-17)
  - **Fix:** `StreamingHuffmanTree::decode` fallback path now correctly gates acceptance on `entry.length() <= available_bits`; skip_bits can no longer silently NOP on insufficient input. All Lh4/5/6/7 methods now round-trip across all chunk sizes.
  - **Goal:** Fix `StreamingLzhDecoder` for `LzhMethod::{Lh4, Lh5, Lh6, Lh7}`. Currently only Lh0 (stored) round-trips reliably. Bug is localized to streaming bit-pump or `StreamingHuffmanTree` PT code-3 skip-state across `decompress()` call boundaries.
  - **Design:** Three phases: (1) Reproduce — add #[ignore]-guarded failing tests per method; (2) Root-cause Lh5 — patch `StreamingHuffmanTree` to defer PT skip-state across invocations; validate at chunk sizes [1..4096]; (3) Assess Lh4/6/7 — if not fixed by Lh5 patch, return `status: deviated`. Do not exceed 2000 lines in `streaming.rs`; use `splitrs` if needed.
  - **Files:** MODIFY `oxiarc-lzhuf/src/streaming.rs`, `tests/streaming_integration.rs`
  - **Tests:** one roundtrip test per method (Lh4/5/6/7) × chunk sizes [1,2,4,16,64,256,1024,4096]; property test (random input + random chunk sequence); edge cases (1 byte, mid-Huffman, mid-PT-skip, window-size input)
- [x] Progress callbacks (planned 2026-04-20)
  - **Goal:** `encode_lzh` / `decode_lzh` batch APIs gain an optional `ProgressHandle` parameter OR a `.with_progress()` builder on the `LzhuffEncoder`/`LzhuffDecoder` streaming types in `streaming.rs`.
  - **Design:**
    - Preferred API: add `.with_progress(handle)` to the streaming encode/decode types that live in `oxiarc-lzhuf/src/streaming.rs` (1479 lines, full streaming implementation). Avoid changing the batch-API signatures.
    - Emit `on_progress(input_consumed, None)` at each block boundary during encode; `on_progress(output_produced, original_size_if_known)` during decode.
  - **Files:** MODIFY `oxiarc-lzhuf/src/streaming.rs`.
  - **Prerequisites:** core primitive already in.
  - **Tests:** streaming encode + decode round-trip; counting sink observes ≥1 call per block; total-consumed ≈ input length.
  - **Risk:** file is large but already well-structured; additions are localized.
- [x] Custom dictionary initialization — `LzhEncoder::with_dictionary(method, dict)` / `set_dictionary`, `LzhDecoder::with_dictionary(method, size, dict)` / `set_dictionary`; delegates to `LzssEncoder/Decoder::preload_dictionary` which seeds ring buffer and hash chains (done 2026-05-16)

### Compatibility
- [x] Extended testing with real LZH archives (done 2026-07-07) — `tests/data/` corpus (6 genuine third-party `.lzh` fixtures from `fragglet/lhasa`, header levels 0/1/2) exercised by `tests/corpus_fixtures.rs` (decode direction) and `tests/lha_oracle.rs` (encode direction, live `lha`/Lhasa CLI oracle via the opt-in `lha-oracle` feature)
- [x] Fuzzing tests (done 2026-07-08) — `tests/corrupt_input.rs` (`decode_lzh_bit_flip_fuzz_never_panics_or_silently_succeeds`, `decode_lzh_heavy_multi_byte_corruption_can_return_err`: bit-flip and heavy multi-byte corruption of real fixtures, asserting the decoder never panics and either errors cleanly or round-trips) and `tests/proptest_roundtrip.rs` (proptest-based property fuzzing)
- [x] Edge case handling (done 2026-07-08) — `LzssDecoder::new` no longer panics on a zero/non-power-of-two window size (now rounds up via `next_power_of_two().max(16)`, matching `LzssEncoder::new`'s normalization); a malformed/truncated `-lh1-` stream paired with an oversized declared output size no longer loops fabricating output to OOM — the bit reader now signals exhaustion and `decode_lh1` returns an error instead

## Known Limitations

1. PMarc `-pm1-`/`-pm2-` not implemented (see the Additional Methods section
   for the licensing/spec reason). Every other LZH-container method — lh0-lh7,
   lhd, lzs, lz4, lz5, pm0 — decodes and encodes.
2. Single-threaded only (batch path; parallel feature available for multi-entry archives)
