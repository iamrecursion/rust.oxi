## [0.2.3] - Unreleased

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-06

A production-readiness hardening release. A systematic multi-agent audit swept the
entire workspace (`oxiblas-core`, `oxiblas-matrix`, `oxiblas-blas`, `oxiblas-lapack`,
`oxiblas-ndarray`, `oxiblas-sparse`), followed by adversarial re-verification of every
proposed fix, resulting in a large batch of correctness, honesty, and documentation
fixes — plus a follow-on hardening pass over that audit closure: soundness fixes for
the sibling call sites the original audit's fixes missed, plus workspace hygiene
(lint/dependency/CI policy, doctest and file-size compliance, fuzz coverage).
No public API breaking changes; a handful of previously-`unsafe fn`-eligible
constructors are now correctly marked `unsafe fn` (see Changed).

### Fixed
- Numerous numerical correctness bugs across BLAS, LAPACK, and sparse routines,
  including Hermitian/symmetric diagonal handling, SVD and eigensolver convergence
  and deflation, sparse factorization fill-in, incremental SVD, and IRAM restart
  logic
- Several fabricated or stub code paths replaced with real, verified algorithms
  (e.g. a dead-code MRRR eigensolver path, an untested symmetric divide-and-conquer
  EVD merge, and fake complex-routine aliases)
- Panics on edge-case inputs (empty, singular, or near-singular matrices) converted
  to proper `Result`-based error handling instead of `unwrap()`/`expect()`/`panic!()`
- Assorted silent-fallback and misleading-documentation issues that could mask
  incorrect results
- `PackedRef::new`/`PackedMut::new` (packed.rs) and `BandedRef::new`/`BandedMut::new`
  (banded.rs) were still safe `pub fn` over raw pointers with no validation, even
  though the sibling `MatRef::new`/`MatMut::new` had already been hardened to
  `unsafe fn` — safe code could construct an out-of-bounds view and read/write past
  the backing allocation. All four are now `unsafe fn` with `# Safety` docs.
- `wasm32.rs` SIMD `extract()`/`insert()` still reached `unreachable_unchecked()` on
  an out-of-range lane index from safe caller code in release builds, after the
  identical bug had been fixed for x86_64/aarch64 — ported the
  `lane_index_out_of_range` panic helper to all six wasm32 call sites.
- `MmapMatMut::create`'s size computation (`row_stride * ncols * size_of::<T>()`)
  used unchecked arithmetic, so an oversized `(nrows, ncols)` could wrap to a small
  file while the returned struct still recorded the original huge dimensions,
  letting ordinary safe accessors write past the mapping. Now uses checked
  arithmetic and re-validates the layout against the mapped file size.
- The four CBLAS modules added to close the "CBLAS surface is incomplete" audit
  finding (`hermitian.rs`, `triangular_symmetric.rs`, `complex_level2.rs`,
  `complex_level1.rs`) shipped with zero `lda`/`ldb`/`ldc`/null-pointer validation,
  reproducing the exact bug class `cblas/basic.rs` had already been hardened
  against. Added a shared `cblas/validate.rs` module and wired
  `gemv_params_valid`/`gemm_params_valid`/-family checks plus null checks into
  every `extern "C"` entry point in the four files, no-oping (matching the
  `xerbla`-then-return convention) on invalid input instead of indexing OOB.
- `CscMatrix`'s `Index` impl still panicked via `expect()` on a structurally-zero
  element after the identical `CsrMatrix` impl had been removed for the same
  reason; removed to match.
- `packed_len()` (`n*(n+1)/2`) and the banded `ldab*ncols` allocation-size
  expressions were still plain, wrapping-in-release arithmetic after `mat.rs`'s
  allocations had been routed through a checked `checked_dim_mul` helper; both now
  use checked multiplication and panic on overflow instead of silently
  under-allocating.
- Matrix Market reader (`mtx.rs`) pre-allocated `Vec::with_capacity(header.nnz)`
  directly from the untrusted size line, so a ~30-byte crafted file
  (`3 3 18446744073709551615`) could trigger a capacity-overflow abort before any
  data line was read. `read_header` now rejects `nnz > nrows*ncols` (coordinate
  format, checked with `saturating_mul`) and uses checked multiplication for the
  array-format `nrows*ncols` cell count, so malformed headers return a
  `MtxError` instead of aborting the process.
- 57 of 64 public-API doctests marked `` ```ignore `` (never compiled or verified)
  across `oxiblas-core`, `oxiblas-matrix`, `oxiblas-lapack`, `oxiblas-ndarray`, and
  `oxiblas-sparse` are now real, executed doctests with concrete inputs and
  assertions on the results (the audit that closed this finding had only fixed 7 of
  the 64).
- `oxiblas-core`'s no_std test-code gating was incomplete for the x86_64 SIMD
  modules: `simd/x86_64/functions.rs` (a `thread_local!` override plus 16
  `is_x86_feature_detected!` call sites and a `println!`) and 4 direct-register
  test functions in `simd/complex.rs` compiled only under `std`, but were not
  `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`-gated — invisible to `--no-default-features` checks
  run on an aarch64 host, since that module tree is itself
  `#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]`-gated and was never actually cross-compiled.
  Confirmed and fixed by adding `--target x86_64-apple-darwin` to the no_std
  verification command (see `TODO.md`); see `TODO.md` for the full file list.
- Two pre-existing test/feature-interaction bugs surfaced by the above
  verification pass (not caused by it): `simd::dispatch::tests::test_aarch64_neon_always_present`
  and `simd::multiver::tests::test_aarch64_neon_always_true` both asserted NEON
  is unconditionally present on AArch64 without accounting for `dispatch.rs`'s
  own `limited_to()` masking, which correctly reports `has_neon = false` under
  the `force-scalar` feature (always active under `--all-features`). Fixed by
  checking `SimdCapabilities::simd_ceiling_bytes() >= 16` before asserting,
  mirroring the already-correct sibling test `test_compute_respects_feature_ceiling`.

### Changed
- Dependencies updated to latest compatible versions
- Documentation corrected in numerous places to accurately describe actual behavior
- `PackedRef::new`, `PackedMut::new`, `BandedRef::new`, `BandedMut::new` are now
  `unsafe fn` (see Fixed above) — existing safe call sites inside this workspace
  were updated to `unsafe { ... }` blocks with `// SAFETY:` justifications;
  downstream callers constructing these types directly from raw pointers will need
  to do the same.
- Hoisted the last four per-crate dependency version pins
  (`oxiblas-ndarray`'s `faer`, `oxiblas-benchmarks`'s `ndarray-linalg`/`blas-src`/
  `cblas-sys`) into `[workspace.dependencies]` so every version lives in one place.
- `oxiblas-blas`'s crate-wide `#![allow(clippy::missing_safety_doc)]`,
  `clippy::ptr_as_ptr`, `clippy::transmute_ptr_to_ref`, `clippy::cast_possible_wrap`,
  `clippy::transmute_undefined_repr`, and `clippy::missing_transmute_annotations`
  lint suppressions were removed; the 74 CBLAS entry points that were missing a
  `# Safety` doc section now have one, and 8 NEON transmute call sites in
  `level1/nrm2.rs` now carry explicit `transmute::<From, To>()` turbofish
  annotations instead of relying on suppressed lints.
- Split 4 source files that had grown past the workspace's 2000-line limit into
  cohesive modules with the public API re-exported from the original path:
  `oxiblas-blas/src/level2/gemv.rs`, `oxiblas-blas/src/cblas/basic.rs`,
  `oxiblas-sparse/src/linalg/eigenvalue/tests.rs`, and
  `oxiblas-sparse/src/linalg/eigenvalue/special.rs`.

### Added
- `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` with `all-features = true` on every publishable
  crate so feature-gated APIs are visible on docs.rs
- `rustfmt.toml`, `clippy.toml` (MSRV pinned to the workspace's `rust-version`),
  `deny.toml` (COOLJAPAN dependency-ban list, `cargo deny check bans` clean),
  `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md` at the workspace root.
- `fuzz/` (an independent `cargo-fuzz` workspace, excluded from the main
  workspace so `cargo build`/`clippy --workspace` never need a nightly
  toolchain) with two real libFuzzer targets: `mtx_matrix_market` (the Matrix
  Market parser) and `mmap_header` (the `.oxiblas` memory-mapped-matrix header
  parser) — the two untrusted-input parsers in the workspace.

### Fixed

- Blocked QR factorization (WY representation): corrected T matrix construction (was using T, must use T^T per DLARFT specification) and corrected block reflector application; 3-7× speedup for large matrices now fully realized

### Changed

### Removed

- `oxiblas-ffi` removed from workspace members (`Cargo.toml` members list); the crate directory is retained as a deprecated archive but is no longer built or published

### Code Quality

- Zero `unwrap()` calls in all production code across the entire workspace
- All source files are under 2,000 lines (100% compliant with refactoring policy)
- 16 previously oversized files (51,890 lines total) refactored into 113 modules; v0.2.0 adds the `scalar.rs` refactoring for a total of 114 modules

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Complex Number Support in ndarray Integration**: Added comprehensive complex-specific LAPACK functions to `oxiblas-ndarray`:
  - `svd_complex_ndarray`: SVD decomposition for complex matrices using one-sided Jacobi algorithm
  - `qr_complex_ndarray`: QR decomposition for complex matrices (unitary Q)
  - `cholesky_hermitian_ndarray`: Cholesky decomposition for Hermitian positive definite matrices
  - `eig_hermitian_ndarray`: Eigenvalue decomposition for Hermitian matrices (real eigenvalues, complex eigenvectors)
  - `ComplexSvdResult` and `HermitianEvdResult` types for complex decomposition results

### Changed

- **Relaxed Trait Bounds**: Removed unnecessary `Real` trait bound from `solve` and `solve_multiple` functions in both `oxiblas-lapack` and `oxiblas-ndarray`, enabling proper support for complex number types (`Complex<f32>`, `Complex<f64>`)

### Fixed

- Minor code formatting improvements in symmetric eigenvalue decomposition tests

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

- **Symmetric Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Fixed critical bug in QR algorithm for tridiagonal matrices where off-diagonal elements were incorrectly stored using `hypot(x, z)` (always positive) instead of `c * x - s * z` (preserves sign). This caused eigenvectors to be computed incorrectly for matrices requiring multiple QR iterations, while eigenvalues remained correct. The fix ensures proper accumulation of Givens rotations into the eigenvector matrix.
