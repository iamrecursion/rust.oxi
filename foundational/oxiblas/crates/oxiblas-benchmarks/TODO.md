## Benchmark Best Practices

### Running Benchmarks
1. **Dedicated Hardware**: Use consistent, idle hardware
2. **Multiple Runs**: Let Criterion handle statistical significance
3. **Thermal Throttling**: Monitor CPU temperature
4. **Background Processes**: Minimize system load
5. **Power Management**: Disable CPU frequency scaling if possible

### Interpreting Results
- **Mean Time**: Primary metric for comparison
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of consistency
- **Throughput**: Operations per second
- **Comparison Ratio**: Direct performance comparison
- **Regression Detection**: >5% slowdown is significant

### Reporting Issues
When reporting performance issues, include:
- Hardware specifications (CPU model, cores, RAM)
- OS and kernel version
- Compiler version and flags
- Benchmark command used
- Full benchmark output
- Comparison with baseline/competitors

## Notes

- Benchmarks should run on CI but **not block** builds (informational only)
- Comparison features are **optional** to avoid mandatory dependencies
- Focus on **reproducibility** and **statistical validity**
- Document **hardware specifications** for all benchmark results
- Maintain **backward compatibility** in benchmark interfaces
