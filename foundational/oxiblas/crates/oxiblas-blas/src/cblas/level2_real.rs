//! CBLAS-compatible real Level-2 routines.
//!
//! Thin C-ABI wrappers around this crate's native Level-2 kernels
//! (`symv`, `syr`, `syr2`, `trmv`, `trsv`, `ger`). The wrappers own only the
//! marshaling concerns that the native (slice-based, column-major) kernels do
//! not: CBLAS `layout`, `uplo`/`trans`/`diag` enum mapping, and strided
//! (`incx`/`incy`, including negative) vector access.
//!
//! # Layout handling
//!
//! For a symmetric operand, reading a column-major buffer as its transpose is a
//! no-op mathematically, so row-major requests only flip `uplo`. For the
//! general rank-1 update `ger` (non-symmetric), row-major additionally swaps the
//! `x`/`y` operands and the `m`/`n` extents. For the triangular products/solves
//! row-major flips `uplo` and toggles the transpose flag.
//!
//! # Increment convention
//!
//! Following reference BLAS, a negative increment traverses the logical vector
//! from its last element toward the first: logical element `i` lives at pointer
//! offset `i*inc` when `inc >= 0`, and `(i - (n-1))*inc` when `inc < 0` (which
//! is `(n-1-i)*|inc| >= 0`). See `vec_offset`.
