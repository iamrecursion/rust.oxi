# Security Policy

## Supported versions

OxiCrypto follows the COOLJAPAN ecosystem's rolling-release model.
Only the **latest released 0.x line** is supported with security
fixes. Older 0.x releases do not receive backported patches; please
upgrade to the latest release before reporting an issue to confirm it
is still reproducible.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** file a public GitHub issue for a suspected security
vulnerability. As a cryptography library, undisclosed vulnerabilities
here can affect downstream consumers directly — report privately by
emailing:

**info@kitasan.io**

Include as much detail as you can: affected version, a minimal
reproduction (code or test case), the observed impact, and — if known —
a suggested fix or mitigation.

Reports are triaged privately by the maintainer. We will acknowledge
receipt as soon as practical, investigate, and coordinate a fix and
disclosure timeline with the reporter before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This policy covers the OxiCrypto crate(s) published from this
repository (https://github.com/cool-japan/oxicrypto). Vulnerabilities
in upstream dependencies should be reported to those projects
directly, though we welcome a heads-up so we can track and update our
dependency pins.
