## [0.2.4] - Unreleased

## [0.2.3] - 2026-08-13

### Added

**kizzasi-metal** (new workspace crate)
- Target-gated activation of candle's Apple Metal backend. Declares `candle-core`/`candle-nn`
  under `cfg(target_vendor = "apple")` with `features = ["metal"]` and plain `candle-core` under
  `cfg(not(target_vendor = "apple"))`, which under `resolver = "2"` keeps the Metal backend out of
  the dependency graph on non-Apple targets.
- `BACKEND_COMPILED`, `unavailable_reason()`, `new_device()`, `is_available()`,
  `device_ordinals()` — the last three return an honest failure (never a CPU device in disguise)
  on targets where the backend was not compiled in.

**kizzasi-io**
- `video-pure` feature: a pure-Rust video backend (the OxiMedia stack — `oximedia-container` /
  `oximedia-core` / `oximedia-cv` / `oximedia-capture` / `oximedia-codec` / `oximedia-simd`, no C
  compiled or linked) alongside the existing FFmpeg-backed `video` feature. Decodes Y4M
  (YUV4MPEG2) files end to end (demux, YUV→RGB/RGBA/Gray conversion, bilinear rescale) and
  captures from cameras on Linux (V4L2), macOS (AVFoundation) and Windows (Media Foundation) —
  `oximedia-capture` negotiates NV12 / YUYV / UYVY / planar-4:2:0 / RGB24 / MJPEG in ascending
  conversion cost, `oximedia-codec` decodes MJPEG, `oximedia-simd` converts the packed 4:2:2
  layouts. A live camera cannot seek (`IoError::Unsupported`, not silent frame-dropping); network
  streams and non-Y4M containers stay FFmpeg-only. New `VideoBackend` enum (`Auto` / `Ffmpeg` /
  `Pure`) on `VideoConfig::backend`: `Auto` (the default) prefers the pure backend per source where
  it can open it and falls back to FFmpeg, forcing a backend errors honestly instead of silently
  falling back if its feature is off or the source is unsupported. `oximedia-*` currently resolves
  through `[patch.crates-io]` to a sibling `../oximedia` checkout (0.2.1 plus further uncommitted
  work) because crates.io tops out at oximedia 0.2.0 — `cargo publish -p kizzasi-io` is blocked
  until oximedia 0.2.2 ships the crates this feature depends on (see the `[patch.crates-io]`
  comment in the root `Cargo.toml`).
- `src/video.rs` (2152 lines; the pre-sweep version was a near-total stub — `VideoReader::new`
  never opened anything, `read_frame` always returned immediate end-of-stream, `metadata()` was
  hardcoded 30fps/0s/1920x1080 — fixed in an earlier pass this cycle, see `backend_ffmpeg`'s own
  doc comment for the details it now replaces) split into `src/video/{mod, types, processing,
  backend_ffmpeg, backend_pure, backend_pure_camera}.rs`. The public `kizzasi_io::Video*` surface
  is unchanged; `backend_ffmpeg` is the only file touching `ffmpeg_next`,
  `backend_pure`/`backend_pure_camera` the only files touching the `oximedia_*` crates.
- `tracing` instrumentation (`debug!`/`info!`) across the video module: backend open/read paths,
  camera device/format resolution, enumeration. The previous `video.rs` had none.

### Changed

**kizzasi-io**
- `mqtt-tls` is now pure Rust. TLS transport moved off rustls's default aws-lc-rs provider (which
  compiles the AWS-LC C/assembly library, `aws-lc-sys`) onto an explicitly-injected pure-Rust
  RustCrypto provider (`oxitls-rustcrypto-provider`, a COOLJAPAN fork of `rustls-rustcrypto`
  carrying the RUSTSEC-2026-0104 fix). Cipher suites narrow to the 9 AEAD suites the provider
  implements — ECDHE-{ECDSA,RSA} × {AES-GCM,ChaCha20}, plus the three TLS 1.3 suites — with **no
  CBC suites**; a broker pinned to CBC-only cipher suites will now fail the handshake. The provider
  is unaudited pure-Rust code.
- `CameraDevice::list_devices()`: with the new `video-pure` feature compiled in, this is now
  `oximedia-capture`'s enumeration on every OS (see Added, above), preferred over the `video`-only
  path even when `video` is also enabled. On Linux specifically this is a behaviour change even for
  existing callers: the `video`-only path lists every `/dev/video*` node unconditionally, while
  `oximedia-capture`'s V4L2 backend reports a node only when `VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` confirms
  `V4L2_CAP_VIDEO_CAPTURE` *and* `V4L2_CAP_STREAMING` — a metadata, output-only, or M2M-encoder
  node that used to appear in the list no longer does once `video-pure` is enabled.

**Dependencies**
- **The tensor backend moved from `candle-core`/`candle-nn` to `oxicandle-core`/`oxicandle-nn`**,
  the COOLJAPAN fork of candle 0.11.0. Upstream candle-core's mandatory `tokenizers` dependency
  selects the `onig` feature, which builds the Oniguruma C library (`onig`/`onig_sys`) — the one C
  compilation that survived every previous purification pass, with no configuration lever inside
  kizzasi to remove it. The fork selects `fancy-regex` instead (upstream candle PR #3790).
  **The default build now compiles no C, for consumers of the published crates as well as for this
  workspace.** That last part is the point of the change: the previous release candidate handled
  this with a `[patch.crates-io]` entry pointing at a sibling `../candle` checkout, which fixed the
  build here and nowhere else — `[patch]` does not propagate to crates.io, so anyone depending on a
  published kizzasi crate still compiled `onig`. Verified against the published crate from outside
  this workspace with `cargo tree -i onig`.

  The dependency *keys* are unchanged (`candle-core` / `candle-nn` with `package = "oxicandle-*"`)
  and the fork keeps the upstream library names, so `use candle_core::…` compiles unchanged and no
  source file in this workspace was touched. `candle-metal-kernels` no longer needs an entry of its
  own: the old patch had to cover it because a path-sourced and a registry-sourced crate of the same
  version are distinct crates to Cargo, which made `--features metal` resolve two incompatible
  instances; both fork crates now depend on the upstream registry `candle-metal-kernels 0.11.0`.
  `deny.toml` bans `onig`/`onig_sys` outright and scopes the pre-existing `zip` exemption to the
  renamed `oxicandle-core` wrapper.

### Fixed

- `cargo build`/`test`/`clippy --all-features` failed on every non-Apple host with
  ``error: `objc2` only works on Apple platforms``. `kizzasi-core`'s `metal` feature forwarded
  `candle-core/metal` directly, and Cargo features are not target-aware, so `--all-features` — the
  command documented in the README and run by CI — pulled candle's Metal backend (and with it
  `objc2`) into Linux and Windows builds. `metal` is now `["dep:kizzasi-metal"]`, so it resolves
  everywhere and is live only on Apple. Enabling it off-Apple is inert but loud:
  `is_metal_available()` is `false`, `get_best_device()` stays on CPU, and `DeviceType::Metal`
  yields a `CoreError::DeviceError` naming the target.
- **kizzasi-io**: `VideoConfig::from_camera` hardcoded `"video4linux2"` as the default
  `camera_format` on every OS, even though `CameraDevice::default_format()` is platform-gated
  (`dshow` on Windows, `avfoundation` on macOS) — the two now agree.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-09

This release spans roughly three months of work across every crate in the workspace: a new
WebGPU acceleration backend, a real `tensorlogic-ir` constraint pipeline, PEAQ perceptual audio
quality evaluation, and — the bulk of the diff — a wide sweep of numerical and logic correctness
fixes in the model, core, and constraint layers, several of which mean previously-shipped
functionality (training, some architectures' state-space recurrences, weight serialization) was
silently non-functional prior to this release. See below for the full breakdown.

### Added

**kizzasi-webgpu** (new workspace crate)
- WebGPU (`wgpu 30`) acceleration backend for kizzasi-core's SSM/signal kernels — pure Rust and
  GPU-free by default, unlocked via the `webgpu` feature flag.
- `WebGpuBackend` for adapter/device management, `GpuBuffer` (storage + staging), buffer
  upload/download.
- WGSL kernels: elementwise SiLU activation, RMS Norm, matrix-vector multiplication, and a
  Blelloch work-efficient parallel prefix scan for the SSM recurrence.
- `WebGpuSsmBackend`, an `SsmBackend` implementation that runs short sequences on the GPU and
  falls back to the CPU backend for longer ones; `webgpu_kernels_demo` example.

**kizzasi-core**
- `SsmBackend` trait, `CpuSsmBackend`, `default_backend()` in a new `ssm_backend` module — the
  pluggable backend abstraction that `WebGpuSsmBackend` above implements.
- INT8 quantization API on `WeightLoader`: `quantize_tensor`/`dequantize_tensor` (per-tensor
  affine) and `quantize_per_channel`/`dequantize_per_channel` (per-channel affine), returning new
  `QuantizedTensor`/`PerChannelQuantizedTensor` types.
- Head-wise (`PruningGranularity::Head`) and block-wise (`PruningGranularity::Block`) structured
  pruning on `StructuredPruner`, configured via `PruningConfig::head_size`/`block_size` and
  `with_head_size()`/`with_block_size()` builders.
- Tracing span instrumentation across attention, SSM scan, and SIMD kernels for latency profiling.
- `int8_quantization_bench` and `parallel_scan_bench` Criterion benchmarks.

**kizzasi-embedded**
- `libm` feature: `f32` math shims (`sqrt`, `round`) for `no_std` builds without `std`.
- Platform presets `stm32h7()`, `rp2040()`, `esp32c3()` in a new `presets` module.
- `no_std_basic`, `fixed_point_cortex_m`, `stm32h7_preset` examples.

**kizzasi-model**
- `tensorlogic_bridge` module bridging kizzasi-logic: `constraint_from_tl_expr()` and
  `compile_constraints()` compile symbolic `TLExpr` constraints into executable
  `CompiledConstraint`s.
- `binary_io` module: shared little-endian binary-read primitives, factored out of the GGUF
  parser for reuse by future binary loaders.
- GGUF: support the `general.alignment` metadata key for tensor data-section alignment
  (previously hardcoded to 32 bytes); `GgufMetaValue::as_u64()`.
- RWKV7 (split from a single `rwkv7.rs` into `rwkv7/{mod,channel_mixing,time_mixing}.rs`):
  `save_weights_json`/`load_weights_json` for both the time-mixing and channel-mixing blocks.
- `ModelFactory::create_rwkv7`/`create_s5` now inject supplied weights into the constructed model
  instead of discarding them with a warning.
- New tests: `hf_weight_roundtrip`, `neural_ode_integration`, `transformer_state_roundtrip`.

**kizzasi-tokenizer**
- PEAQ (ITU-R BS.1387-1 Basic Model) perceptual audio quality evaluator (`peaq` module):
  `PeaqEvaluator` computes all 11 Basic Model Output Variables through a Bark-band `EarModel`
  (outer/middle-ear weighting, masking spreading, IIR time-smoothing) and maps them to a
  Distortion Index and Objective Difference Grade (`OdgGrade`, range `[-4, 0]`) via an 11→3→1
  neural network. The network weights are LCG-seeded placeholders pending the paid ITU BS.1387-1
  Annex 2 tables (`peaq::nn::WEIGHTS_VERIFIED == false`), so ODG/DI values are qualitative trend
  indicators, not certified scores.
- Perceptual/Bark-scale psychoacoustic quantization (`perceptual` module): `PerceptualQuantizer`
  allocates bits per critical band proportional to exceedance over the Terhardt absolute
  threshold of hearing, using Hann-windowed STFT/ISTFT via the new `oxifft` dependency;
  `BarkBands`, `frequency_to_bark`, `absolute_threshold_db` exposed as standalone functions.
- Multi-speaker tokenization (`multi_speaker` module): `MultiSpeakerTokenizer` with a
  k-means++-initialized, EMA-updated `SpeakerCodebook`, blind speaker inference
  (`encode_blind`), explicit speaker assignment (`encode_with_speaker`), and speaker re-tagging
  (`re_target`).
- `range_coder_bench` benchmark; `perceptual_quant`, `vqvae_roundtrip`, `inference_integration`
  examples.
- `SpeechTokenizer` now implements `Debug`.
- New regression, edge-case (NaN/Inf/subnormal/empty/boundary), and transform-roundtrip test
  suites.

**kizzasi-logic**
- Real `tensorlogic-ir` (`0.1.1`) backing for symbolic constraints, replacing the previous
  commented-out placeholder: `TlExprCompiler` lowers `TLExpr` to the stack-VM
  `CompiledConstraint` (with `compile_optimized()` applying algebraic simplification and constant
  folding first); `TLExprEvaluator` is a direct f32 evaluator using Gödel soft-logic semantics
  (`And`=min, `Or`=max, `Not`=1−a, `Imply`=max(1−a,b)); `tl_var()`/`tl_const()` build `TLExpr`
  leaf nodes; `TLExpr`/`TlTerm`/`TypeAnnotation` re-exported from `kizzasi_logic`.
- `ConstraintLearner::learn_box_constraints_as_expr()`, `Constraint::bound()`,
  `LinearConstraint::shift_rhs()`/`update_coefficients_towards()`,
  `QuadraticSubproblem::with_lower_bound()`/`with_upper_bound()`.
- Custom n-th order (up to 8th) backward finite-difference derivatives on
  `DerivativeConstraint`/`DerivativeOrder::Custom` (previously unimplemented above 3rd order).
- `tests/control_and_learning_integration.rs`: end-to-end MPC, constraint repair, and online
  learning coverage.

**kizzasi-inference**
- `InferenceError::Timeout` variant for request/response timeouts.
- `LoraAdapterLoader::save()` to persist a `LoraAdapter` and its `LoraConfig` to disk.
- `FilterTransformer` stream transformer (filters items via a synchronous predicate).
- `state_compression_bench` benchmark.
- `ensemble_integration`, `multimodal_integration`, `speculative_integration` integration tests
  against live S4D/Mamba models.

**kizzasi-io**
- `WebSocketStream::check_ping_signal()` to drain ping-interval ticks and send WebSocket ping
  frames.

**kizzasi-python**
- `BeamSearch`, `ConstrainedBeamSearch` (Python-callable hard/soft constraints), and
  `RejectionSampler` for autoregressive decoding.
- `EnsemblePredictor`: multi-model ensemble prediction (average, weighted, weighted-average,
  median, confidence, majority-vote strategies).
- `OptimizedPredictor`: workspace pooling, SIMD kernels, and an optional TTL-based LRU result
  cache, with `cache_stats()`/`optimization_stats()` introspection.
- `LoRAAdapter`: register per-module layers from NumPy base weights, run `forward()`, and
  merge/unmerge corrections into the base weights in place.
- `SamplingConfig`/`Sampler`: greedy, temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling, single-vector and
  batched.

**kizzasi-macros**
- `#[config(default = EXPR)]`, `#[config(validate = "path")]`, `#[config(skip)]` field attributes
  in `#[derive(KizzasiConfig)]` are now actually honored (previously accepted but silently
  ignored).
- A named `<name>_preset()` constructor per `#[preset(name = "...", field = value, ...)]` struct
  attribute in `#[derive(Preset)]`, supporting multiple presets per struct.
- `#[metrics]`-annotated field (or a field literally named `collector`) and generic struct
  support in `#[derive(Instrumented)]`.

### Changed

**Dependencies**
- `scirs2-core`/`-linalg`/`-signal`/`-fft`/`-series`: 0.4.2 → 0.6.5.
- `candle-core`/`candle-nn`: 0.10.2 → 0.11.0.
- `oxicode`: 0.2 → 0.2.6.
- `oxifft`: 0.3 → 0.4.2 (now also a direct dependency of kizzasi-tokenizer, used by the new
  perceptual quantizer).
- `oxirs-core`/`oxirs-gql`: 0.2.4 → 0.4.1.
- `pyo3`: 0.28 → 0.29; `scirs2-numpy`: 0.4.2 → 0.6.5.
- `safetensors`: 0.7 → 0.8.
- `cpal`: 0.17 → 0.18 (kizzasi-io adapted to the new `build_input_stream`/`build_output_stream`
  signatures).
- `tower-http`: 0.6 → 0.7; `tokio-serial`: 5.4 → 5.5.
- `wasm-bindgen`: 0.2.118 → 0.2.126; `js-sys`: 0.3.95 → 0.3.103.
- New workspace member `crates/kizzasi-webgpu`.

**Breaking changes**
- kizzasi-embedded: `std` now implies `alloc`; `no_std` builds must additionally enable the new
  `libm` feature for `f32` math, or they fail to compile with a directed `compile_error!`.
- kizzasi-core: `CausalConv1d::set_history`/`DepthwiseCausalConv1d::set_history` now return
  `CoreResult<()>` instead of panicking on a mismatched history length.
- kizzasi-core: `PruningConfig` gained `head_size`/`block_size` fields — construct via
  `Default`/builders rather than a struct literal.
- kizzasi-tokenizer: the `entropy` range coder (now split into `entropy/{mod,encoder,decoder}.rs`)
  emits an LZMA-style carry-propagating byte stream; data encoded with 0.2.1 cannot be decoded by
  0.2.2 and vice versa (type/function names unchanged).
- kizzasi-tokenizer: `DCTTokenizer`/`WaveletTokenizer::encode` now prepend a `max_val` header
  token, so `embed_dim()` and encoded token-array lengths grow by one.
- kizzasi-logic: `MPCSolution` gained a `constraint_violation: f32` field.
- kizzasi-logic: `ConstraintSynthesizer::synthesize_from_template()` and its template methods now
  return `TLExpr` instead of the removed `SymbolicExpr`.
- kizzasi-inference: new `InferenceError::Timeout` variant (exhaustive `match`es need a new arm).
- kizzasi-io: `WebSocketStream::start_ping_task` now returns
  `(JoinHandle<()>, mpsc::Receiver<()>)` instead of `JoinHandle<()>`.
- kizzasi-macros: `#[derive(Preset)]` now generates one `<name>_preset()` method per declared
  preset instead of a single fixed `preset()`; existing `.preset()` call sites no longer compile.

**Other**
- kizzasi-core: `FusedAttentionKernel::forward_parallel` now runs a genuine rayon-parallel
  implementation, and `parallel_scan`/`parallel_ssm_batch` dispatch to scirs2-core's Blelloch
  parallel scan / rayon batch iteration, instead of silently falling back to sequential execution.
- kizzasi-core: `activations::fast_exp_avx512` is now a true AVX-512-vectorized
  Cody-Waite/polynomial implementation instead of a scalar `exp()` fallback; results may differ
  slightly in the last bits.
- kizzasi-logic: `ConstraintRepairer`'s `ElasticProgramming` strategy now descends until violation
  is within tolerance instead of stopping at the slack budget, changing repaired-point output.
- kizzasi-python: `lib.rs` split into `config`/`predictor`/`ensemble`/`optimized`/`lora`/
  `sampling`/`beam_search` modules (existing `Predictor`/`Config`/`ModelType`/`ConstraintSpec`
  classes unaffected); `KizzasiConfig`/`Preset`/`Instrumented` derive-macro errors are now
  spanned compile errors instead of raw panics; `LazyKizzasi` recovers from a poisoned mutex
  instead of panicking.
- kizzasi-inference/kizzasi-io: benches/adapters updated for cpal 0.18; the `advanced_features`
  bench now requires the `streaming` feature (previously unconditional).
- Replaced `unwrap()` with descriptive `expect()`/proper error returns across kizzasi-core,
  kizzasi-logic, and kizzasi-io per COOLJAPAN no-unwrap policy.

### Fixed

**kizzasi-core**
- `FlashAttention::forward` misinterpreted its `[batch, seq_len, d_model]` input as
  already-split `[seq_len, num_heads, head_dim]` (the old `reshape_qkv` was a no-op), and for
  `batch_size > 1` computed and copied only the first batch element into every output batch slot.
- `Mamba2Layer::forward`: the discretized `A` matrix was computed as `(-a_log.exp()).abs()`
  (always positive) instead of `-a_log.exp()` (negative), letting the recurrent state diverge
  over long sequences.
- `S5Layer`: the per-block continuous-time `A` diagonal was initialized as `exp(log_lambda)`
  (always positive) instead of `-exp(log_lambda)`, and `discretize_block` used an ad hoc
  first-order approximation instead of exact ZOH.
- `matrix_exp_pade`/`zoh_discretize`: replaced a truncated low-order Padé approximation and a
  first-order `B_d` estimate with an exact Padé[13,13] matrix exponential (Higham 2005) and
  closed-form zero-order-hold discretization via an LU-based linear solve.
- `SelectiveSSM::step`: the discretization time-step `Δ` was hardcoded to `0.1`, giving the model
  no input-dependent selectivity; `Δ` is now `softplus(dt_proj · x)`, restoring the Mamba
  selective-scan mechanism.
- `TrainableSSM::ssm_layer` ignored the `A`, `B`, `C` matrices entirely (only computing a `D * x`
  skip connection), so state-space parameters never received gradients during training; it now
  runs the full S4D-style selective-scan recurrence.
- **`Trainer::fit()` built training and validation batches as a hardcoded empty `Vec::new()`
  every epoch, so no training or validation ever actually ran.** Batches are now built from the
  `TimeSeriesDataLoader` via a new `collect_epoch_batches` helper.
- `TrainingConfig::grad_clip` was silently inert — `train_epoch` consumed the unclipped gradients
  before the (no-op) `clip_gradients` ever ran; gradients are now clipped by global L2 norm before
  the optimizer step.
- `Trainer::compute_grad_norm` always returned the hardcoded placeholder `1.0` instead of the
  true global L2 gradient norm.
- **`WeightLoader::save_safetensors` wrote an empty, invalid buffer**; it now serializes real
  `TensorView`s via the `safetensors` crate.
- `CausalConv1d`/`DepthwiseCausalConv1d` `get_history()`/`set_history()` could drop the most
  recently buffered frame when snapshotting mid-`forward_step`, corrupting output after a
  restore.
- Potential panics on `NaN` in `StructuredPruner`/`GradientPruner` threshold and importance sorts.

**kizzasi-model**
- Mixture-of-Experts `Router` and `Expert` weights were zero-initialized (routing was
  input-independent and every expert's output was identically zero); both now use
  Glorot/He-uniform initialization, and `Expert` is a real two-layer SiLU feed-forward network.
- `Mamba2Layer`'s SSD state update ignored the actual per-head input value (multiplied the
  B-projection by a hardcoded `0.01` constant instead of the input).
- `S5`'s `S5Block` ZOH discretization produced `a_bar > 1` (unbounded, unstable state growth)
  from an inverted sign convention on `log_a`.
- RWKV (v4) `TimeMixing`'s WKV recurrence failed to exponentiate the key term (`exp(k)`) in the
  denominator, which could go negative, get clamped to `1e-8`, and inflate the output toward
  ~1e8.
- `Transformer::get_states`/`set_states` silently dropped the value (V) cache and restored keys
  only, corrupting attention after any state restore; both K and V now round-trip (the packed
  `HiddenState` layout is incompatible with snapshots taken before this fix).
- The standard (L2, non-decoupled) Adam optimizer applied `weight_decay` unscaled by the learning
  rate (up to ~1000x too strong versus the intended per-step decay); it now applies the same
  `(1 - lr * weight_decay)` factor as AdamW.
- `Mamba`'s `SelectiveSSM` ZOH discretization: the near-zero-decay fallback substituted
  `a_n = -1.0`, collapsing `b_bar` to ~0 and suppressing state updates; it now uses the correct
  L'Hôpital limit `delta * B`.
- `hybrid::AttentionBlock` computed attention scores over the full concatenated Q/K/V vectors
  instead of per head; it now slices each head's `head_dim` span before scoring.
- `LifLayer`'s absolute refractory period continued applying `leak_factor` decay to the membrane
  voltage instead of holding it at the reset value, for `SoftReset` and other non-hard reset
  modes.
- `h3::ShiftSSM` iterated its input history oldest-first, multiplying `shift_weights` row 0 by
  the oldest buffered input instead of the current one.
- HuggingFace Mamba checkpoint loading assumed a hardcoded `state_size = 16` when inferring
  `dt_rank`; it now probes common state sizes (16/32/64/128) and picks the one yielding a valid
  power-of-two `dt_rank`.
- `SsmBackward`'s `dx` gradient multiplied two independent means instead of the per-timestep dot
  product scaled correctly, producing incorrect input gradients.
- `pytorch_compat::convert::chw_to_hwc`/`transpose_if_needed` were no-op placeholders
  (`tensor.clone()`) despite their documented purpose; they now perform the actual transpose.
- **`save_weights` on `Mamba`, `Mamba2`, `Rwkv`, `S4D`, and `Transformer` silently wrote the JSON
  `save_weights_json` format while named/documented as SafeTensors**, producing files that
  `ModelLoader`/`load_weights` and any real SafeTensors reader could not parse; all five now
  serialize genuine, round-trippable SafeTensors binaries.

**kizzasi-tokenizer**
- `TrainableContinuousTokenizer`'s Xavier initialization called `Tensor::affine` with `(mul, add)`
  swapped, so encoder/decoder weights were all initialized to the same constant instead of scaled
  random values.
- `DCTTokenizer::decode`/`WaveletTokenizer::decode` dequantized using a hardcoded `max_val = 1.0`,
  silently mis-scaling reconstruction for any signal whose peak coefficient magnitude differed
  from 1.0; the true peak magnitude is now carried through as a header token.
- `RangeEncoder`/`RangeDecoder` precision bugs on long or skewed symbol sequences (previously
  masked by `#[ignore]`d tests); the rewritten carry-propagating coder now round-trips correctly.
- `NonUniformQuantizer::lloyd_max_gaussian` now runs the actual Lloyd-Max boundary/centroid
  iteration to convergence instead of a crude percentile approximation.
- `PerceptualMetrics::weighted_snr_db` was a placeholder that just copied `segmental_snr_db`; it
  now computes a true IEC 61672-1 A-weighted frequency-domain SNR.
- `MuLawCodec::quantize` returned an out-of-range level (256) for input `1.0` on an 8-bit codec
  whose valid levels are `0..=255`; the result is now clamped to `levels - 1`.

**kizzasi-logic**
- `ConsensusADMM` dual residual accumulated per block instead of once per iteration,
  over-reporting it by a factor of √(num_blocks).
- `BendersDecomposition::solve_master` nudged a violated feasibility cut by an arbitrary fixed
  `+0.1` instead of restoring feasibility; it now takes a minimum-norm projected-gradient step.
- `QuadraticSubproblem::solve` clipped every element to `lb[0]`/`ub[0]` when only one-sided
  bounds were set; bounds now apply element-wise.
- `BacktrackingSearch::with_forward_checking(true)` was a no-op; it now prunes domains via
  `ForwardChecker` before recursing.
- `ConstraintRepairer` and `IncrementalSolver` (`add_constraint`, `modify_constraint`, its repair
  loop, `recompute_violations`) always read and perturbed dimension 0 regardless of a
  constraint's declared dimension, so constraints on other dimensions never converged.
- `ConflictResolver::might_conflict` always returned `false`; it now detects real structural
  conflicts (disjoint bounds, strict-boundary contradictions, incompatible equalities/ranges).
- `MPCSolution::is_feasible()` was tautologically true (`total_cost < f32::INFINITY`); it now
  also checks tracked `constraint_violation` against tolerance.
- `OnlineConstraintLearner::observe()`, `ActiveConstraintBoundaryLearner::refine()`, and
  `FeedbackConstraintTuner::add_feedback()` each computed an update and discarded it; all three
  now apply their computed adjustments.
- `ConstraintSynthesizer::synthesize_box()` discarded the upper bound (synthesized constraints
  were unbounded above); `synthesize_quadratic()` returned a mislabeled linear bound instead of
  an actual quadratic form.
- `ConstraintLearner::learn_box_constraints()` returned an inverted `f32::MAX`/`f32::MIN`-based
  range when no example had data for the requested dimension; it now returns an error.
- Hardened `ConstraintLearner::learn_linear_separator()` and `ConstraintSynthesizer` against
  out-of-bounds panics on empty or ragged example/variable inputs.
- `MinimalViolatingSubsetFinder::find_mvs()` always returned every violated constraint; it now
  performs gradient-based greedy redundancy removal to return an actual minimal subset.
- `Colormap::Viridis::map()` used an inaccurate ad hoc polynomial (off by over 100 RGB units at
  the midpoint); it now interpolates over 9 published Viridis reference anchors.

**kizzasi-inference**
- `MqttAdapter::request()` previously always failed with `NotImplemented`; it now correlates
  requests and responses via an internal oneshot channel and returns the real response, or a
  `Timeout` error after 30 seconds.
- `LoraAdapterLoader::load()` previously returned a zero-filled placeholder adapter regardless of
  what was on disk; it now reads and reconstructs the actual matrices written by `save()`
  (returns `Err` if weight files are missing, instead of silently succeeding with zeros).
- `ModelRegistry` now constructs `NeuralOde` and `MultiModal` models instead of rejecting them
  with a "not yet supported" error.
- `Sampler` now honors `SamplingConfig::seed` for reproducible categorical sampling (previously
  always drew from OS entropy regardless of the configured seed), and `temperature_sample` no
  longer produces `NaN` at or near zero temperature (short-circuits to greedy sampling).
- `STLFormula::Until` now evaluates `phi1` over the entire prefix `[t, t']` per standard
  quantitative STL semantics, rather than only from the window's lower bound.

**kizzasi-io**
- `StreamRecorder` JSON output now terminates the header with a newline so it no longer merges
  with the first frame and fails to parse.
- `StreamPlayer` now supports JSON and CSV playback and frame seeking for binary recordings —
  both previously failed immediately with "not yet implemented" errors.
- `WebSocketStream`'s ping-keepalive task now actually sends WebSocket ping frames on each
  interval tick instead of only logging a debug message, and skips a spurious immediate first
  tick.

**kizzasi-python**
- `EnsemblePredictor::stats()`'s `avg_variance` was hardcoded to `0.0`; it now reports the actual
  inter-model prediction variance.

### Removed
- kizzasi-logic: the `SymbolicExpr` enum, its inherent methods (`var`, `constant`, `add`, `sub`,
  `mul`, `le`, `ge`, `evaluate`, `simplify`), and its `Display` impl — superseded by
  `tensorlogic_ir::TLExpr` and the new `TLExprEvaluator`.
