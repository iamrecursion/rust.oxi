//! WAL-integrated writes and crash-recovery replay for the TDB store (F3).
//!
//! Every mutating store operation is bracketed in a WAL transaction
//! (`Begin -> DataOp -> Commit`) so that a *committed* write survives a crash
//! that happens *before the next* [`sync`](crate::store::TdbStore::sync). On
//! reopen the committed operations found in the WAL are replayed on top of the
//! last checkpoint (the superblock), reconstructing the exact committed state.
//!
//! # Why operation-level (logical) redo rather than full-page images
//!
//! The [`LogRecord::DataOp`] records written here carry a compact,
//! operation-level redo payload (the interned triple/quad and its terms), not
//! full 4 KiB page before/after images. That is a deliberate design choice for
//! this storage engine, forced by three properties of the surrounding code:
//!
//! 1. **Per-commit durability is required.** The crash-recovery contract
//!    demands that committed writes survive a reopen *without* an intervening
//!    `sync()`. That forces the committing transaction's effect to be in the
//!    WAL at commit time — page-image logging would therefore have to log every
//!    page a transaction dirtied, on every commit.
//! 2. **The catalog lives only in the superblock.** B+Tree roots, counts and
//!    the next dictionary id are persisted only by `sync()`. Operation-level
//!    redo sidesteps this entirely: replaying the logical operation on top of
//!    the reconstructed catalog rebuilds the in-memory indexes directly, so no
//!    per-page catalog surgery is needed during recovery.
//! 3. **Small per-record WAL size.** [`WriteAheadLog`](crate::transaction::WriteAheadLog) retains every appended
//!    entry in an in-memory buffer, and [`crate::storage::FileManager`] fsyncs
//!    on every page write. Full-page-image-per-commit logging of the existing
//!    10k-triple round-trip workloads would produce ~gigabyte WALs and an
//!    equally large in-memory buffer. Operation-level redo keeps each record at
//!    ~100 bytes, so the WAL stays small and the suite stays fast. This bounds
//!    per-record *size*, not the *count* of records between checkpoints: the
//!    total WAL size (and in-memory buffer) is bounded by periodic
//!    [`sync`](crate::store::TdbStore::sync) — explicit, or the automatic
//!    checkpoint triggered every
//!    [`TdbConfig::wal_checkpoint_op_threshold`](crate::store::TdbConfig) single
//!    writes (see `TdbStore::wal_log_op`).
//!
//! Recovery is **redo-only** and transaction-atomic: each store operation is a
//! complete, independently-committed transaction, so there is never a partial
//! transaction to undo — a crash either finds a `Commit` for a `DataOp` (replay
//! it) or does not (skip it). The full-page-image [`LogRecord::Update`] path and
//! the lower-level [`crate::recovery::RecoveryManager`] remain available for
//! physical page redo and are unaffected by this module.
