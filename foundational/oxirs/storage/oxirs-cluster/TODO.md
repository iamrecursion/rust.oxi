## Future Roadmap

### v0.3.0 - Extended Scale (Q2 2026)
- [x] 1000-node cluster support — phase A: gossip fanout + hash-ring scaling (completed 2026-05-01)
  - **Goal:** Concrete first phase. Replace O(N) hot paths in gossip and consistent-hash ring with O(log N) / bounded-fanout structures, validated by an in-memory simulation harness scaling from 10 → 1000 nodes. No real network. Phase B (log-replication topology, witness nodes) and phase C (multi-process E2E) deferred.
  - **Design:** Audit pass to find O(N) hot paths. Hash-ring upgrade to O(log N) via `BTreeMap<u64, NodeId>` virtual-node placement. `GossipFanout` config with `Bounded(usize)`, `Sqrt` (epidemic-protocol default), and `Unbounded` variants; default `Sqrt` for clusters > 32 nodes. Anti-entropy throttle (max 4 concurrent syncs per node; excess queues). New `simulation/` module — `SimCluster<N>` in a single tokio runtime with bounded mailbox channels; `scaling_bench.rs` drives 10/100/1000-node scenarios. Metrics snapshot to JSON for regression tracking.
  - **Files:** `storage/oxirs-cluster/src/hash_ring.rs` (upgrade), `src/gossip/fanout.rs` (new), `src/anti_entropy.rs` (throttle), `src/simulation/{mod.rs,scaling_bench.rs}` (new), `src/lib.rs` (re-export sim under `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "simulation"))]`), `tests/scaling_test.rs`, `Cargo.toml` (`simulation` feature).
  - **Prerequisites:** `tokio` (already), `BTreeMap` (std).
  - **Tests:** 10-node sim converges within 5 rounds; 1000-node sim within 25 rounds; ring lookup sub-millisecond at 1000 virtual nodes; fanout limit enforced; anti-entropy throttle queues correctly.
  - **Risk:** simulation vs. real-cluster divergence. Mitigation: document as model-level guarantee; seeded scheduler for reproducibility.
- [x] 1000-node cluster support Phase C — real-TCP-network E2E harness (planned 2026-05-01)
  - **Goal:** Prove gossip and replication over real TCP sockets (localhost, single-process, multiple tokio tasks). Integration tests verify convergence with actual network I/O.
  - **Design:** `tcp_cluster::codec` — length-prefixed (u32 BE + JSON) framing for `ClusterMessage` (Gossip/Ping/Pong/Replicate/ReplicateAck). `TcpClusterNode` binds `127.0.0.1:0` (OS-assigned port), spawns a listener task (accept → handle_connection) and a gossip timer task (periodic random-peer sampling with `GossipFanout::resolve`). `GossipState` is LWW by version. `TcpClusterNetwork` wires N nodes into a full-mesh and provides `wait_converged` polling helper. Internal peer selection uses an Xorshift64 PRNG seeded from `SystemTime`; no external RNG crate.
  - **Files:** `src/tcp_cluster/{mod.rs,codec.rs,node.rs,network.rs}`, `src/lib.rs`, `tests/tcp_cluster_test.rs`.
  - **Tests:** 15 tests — codec round-trips, node start/addr, gossip 2-node, 3-node chain, 5-node Sqrt, multi-key propagation, LWW win, graceful shutdown, ping/pong, 10-node Sqrt convergence, shutdown-all, localhost config, GossipState empty, TcpNodeError display, Replicate/Ack over TCP.
  - **Risk:** Port-conflict between parallel tests — mitigated by using port 0 (OS-assigned) everywhere.
- [x] 1000-node cluster support Phase B — log-replication topology + witness nodes (planned 2026-05-01)
  - **Goal:** Replace O(N) all-to-all log shipping with √N-relay hierarchical topology. Add witness nodes for quorum-participation without full log storage.
  - **Design:** `ReplicationTopology::build` selects R = ceil(√N) relay nodes (one per AZ, AZ-affinity assignment for leaves). Witness nodes are assigned to their nearest relay but carry `ReplicationRole::Witness`. `WitnessNode` implements Raft §5.2 vote logic and §5.3 AppendEntries with tail-window eviction. Topology is immutable after construction; rebuild on membership changes.
  - **Files:** `src/log_replication_topology.rs`, `src/witness_node.rs`, `src/lib.rs`, `tests/phase_b_test.rs`.
  - **Tests:** 20 tests — 12 topology (single-node, small cluster, 1000-node, hop distances, upstream/downstream, message bound, AZ locality, witness marking) + 8 witness (vote grant/deny, stale term, append success/rejection, out-of-window, tail eviction, commit-index advance).
  - **Risk:** Relay count arithmetic — use ceil(√N) and accept range 30–33 for N=1000.
- [x] Enhanced cross-datacenter replication (completed 2026-04-30)
  - **Goal:** Active-active geo geometry with per-region Raft groups, cross-region async log shipping, CRDT-based conflict resolution.
  - **Design:** Add `ActiveActiveGeoConfig` (regions, primary tier mapping, write routing rules). Per-region Raft groups, cross-region async log shipping, CRDT (last-write-wins or vector-clock) conflict resolution. Anti-entropy across regions via Merkle tree comparison (extend existing intra-cluster Merkle to cross-region). Region failover: if primary region unreachable, demote and promote secondary; replay outstanding writes once recovered.
  - **Files:** `src/replication/{active_active_geo,region_failover,cross_region_anti_entropy}.rs` (new), `tests/cross_dc.rs` (new)
  - **Tests:** unit on region failover state machine; integration 3-region cluster simulator (kill primary region, verify secondary takeover + replay convergence)
  - **Risk:** CRDT correctness for non-Raft writes is subtle. Mitigation: default to Raft-only writes; CRDT path opt-in feature.
- [x] Advanced compression algorithms (completed 2026-04-28)
  - **Goal:** Codec selection trait with multiple OxiARC-backed implementations; per-shard/per-tenant config; default unchanged.
  - **Design:** Compressor trait {compress, decompress}. Implementations via oxiarc-* crates (identity, RLE, LZ4, Zstd). CodecRegistry for selection by name. Config in shard/tenant metadata.
  - **Files:** src/compression/{codecs,registry}.rs (new), src/compression/mod.rs (new)
  - **Tests:** round-trip per codec on edge inputs (empty, zeros, random, repetitive)
- [x] Real-time streaming integration (completed 2026-04-30)
  - **Goal:** Wire `oxirs-stream` ingest pipeline directly into Raft log so streaming events become durable cluster state without going through SPARQL UPDATE.
  - **Design:** Added `oxirs-cluster::streaming` with a **local** `StreamSink` trait (avoids a circular `oxirs-stream` dependency that W3-S11 will close from the producer side), `ClusterSink` that proposes through `ConsensusManager::propose_command` using existing `RdfCommand::Insert/Delete/Clear`, `BackpressureBridge` exposing a `BackpressureSignal { Continue, Slow, Stop }` with hysteresis, and a pluggable `EventMapper` (default impl maps `StreamMessage` 1:1 to Raft commands; reuses the existing `stream_integration::StreamMessage` shape).
  - **Files:** `src/streaming/{mod,cluster_sink,backpressure_bridge,event_mapper}.rs` (new), `tests/streaming_integration.rs` (new)
  - **Prerequisites:** Raft + WAL (existing); reuses local `stream_integration::StreamMessage` (existing)
  - **Tests:** 25 unit tests (backpressure hysteresis, mapper edge cases, sink stats/leader/backpressure gates) + 5 integration tests (3-node durability, leader-kill survival, backpressure refusal, ordering, empty batch). All 1684 oxirs-cluster tests pass; ZERO clippy / fmt issues.
  - **Deviation note:** The plan referenced `oxirs-stream::StreamSink`, `RaftLogEntry::StreamEvent`, and `oxirs-stream::schema_mapper` — none exist as named in `oxirs-stream`. Adapted by defining `StreamSink` as a local trait, mapping events down onto the existing `RdfCommand` payload, and shipping a local `EventMapper`. W3-S11 will implement the producer side from `oxirs-stream` against the local trait.
- [x] Advanced backup policies (completed 2026-04-28)
  - **Goal:** Backup-policy DSL with retention tiers (hot/warm/cold), GFS rotation, encryption-at-rest tagging, policy executor + audit log.
  - **Design:** BackupPolicy{schedule:CronSchedule, retention:RetentionTier, gfs:Option<GfsRotation>, encryption:EncryptionConfig, destination:DestinationConfig}. GFS = daily/weekly/monthly cascade. Policy executor + audit log.
  - **Files:** src/backup/{policy,retention,gfs,executor,destination}.rs (new), src/backup/mod.rs (new), tests/backup_policy.rs (new)
  - **Tests:** unit per-tier + integration full backup→restore cycle; GFS simulation over 100 days
- [x] SLA-based resource management (completed 2026-04-30)
  - **Goal:** Per-node SLA admission control on Raft log writes + read replicas, reusing shared `oxirs-core::sla` types.
  - **Design:** Reuse SlaClass/AdmissionController from `oxirs-core::sla` (introduced in W2-S4). Per-node `SlaAdmissionConfig`: max_qps_per_class, max_concurrent_per_class. Wire into raft log proposer (`raft::proposer::propose`) and read-replica serving (`raft::reader::serve`).
  - **Files:** `src/sla/{admission,proposer_gate,reader_gate}.rs` (new), `tests/sla_admission.rs` (new)
  - **Prerequisites:** W2-S4 (oxirs-core::sla)
  - **Tests:** unit on per-tier admission token math; integration SLA workload simulator
  - **Risk:** None — straightforward gate insertion.
