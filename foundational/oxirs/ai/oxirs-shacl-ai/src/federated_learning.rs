//! Federated Learning for Distributed SHACL Shape Learning
//!
//! This module implements federated learning capabilities allowing multiple
//! knowledge graph instances to collaboratively learn SHACL shapes while
//! preserving data privacy and enabling distributed intelligence.
//!
//! # Module layout
//!
//! - [`crate::federated_learning_types`]: All structs, enums, and data model types.
//! - [`crate::federated_learning_trainer`]: Training coordinator, consensus, BFT, and HoneyBadger BFT.
//! - [`crate::federated_learning_privacy`]: Differential privacy, SMPC, and noise mechanisms.

// Re-export all public types from the sub-modules so existing code
// that imports from `federated_learning` continues to compile.
