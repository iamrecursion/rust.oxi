//! SHACL Advanced Features (SHACL-AF)
//!
//! This module implements advanced SHACL features including:
//! - SHACL Rules for data transformation
//! - SHACL Functions for custom operations
//! - Advanced target definitions
//! - Conditional constraints
//! - Qualified value shapes
//! - Recursive shape definitions
//!
//! Based on the W3C SHACL Advanced Features specification.
//!
//! Note: This is an alpha implementation. Many features are placeholders
//! that will be fully implemented in future releases.
