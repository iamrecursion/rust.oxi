| **oxirs-rule** | Production Ready | 2252 tests | Rule-based reasoning with RDFS/OWL support |
| **oxirs-shacl** | Production Ready | 2210 tests | W3C SHACL validation engine |
| **oxirs-star** | Production Ready | 1708 tests | RDF-star/SPARQL-star support |
| **oxirs-vec** | Production Ready | 1790 tests | Vector search with SPARQL integration |
| **oxirs-ttl** | Production Ready | 1852 tests | Streaming Turtle/TriG parser and serializer |
| **oxirs-samm** | Production Ready | 1609 tests | SAMM/AAS support with code generators |
| **oxirs-geosparql** | Production Ready | 1967 tests | OGC GeoSPARQL 1.0/1.1 implementation |

### Features

- SPARQL 1.1/1.2 query processing with federation support
- W3C SHACL validation with all 27 constraint types
- RDF-star quoted triples and annotations
- Vector similarity search with 20+ distance metrics
- Rule-based reasoning (RDFS, OWL 2 RL)
- Geospatial queries with WKT/GML support
- Streaming RDF parsing with zero-copy optimization
- SAMM aspect model processing with 16 code generators

## Roadmap

### v0.1.0 - Released (January 7, 2026)
- ✅ Production-ready engine modules
- ✅ SPARQL 1.1/1.2, SHACL, RDF-star, vector search, TTL, SAMM, GeoSPARQL

### v0.2.3 - Current Release (March 16, 2026)
- ✅ Advanced query optimization techniques
- ✅ Enhanced reasoning strategies
- ✅ Performance improvements for large datasets
- ✅ Additional validation features
- ✅ Distributed query execution
- ✅ Horizontal scaling support
- ✅ Advanced federation optimization
- ✅ Cross-module integration improvements

### v0.3.0 - Planned (Q2 2026)
- [x] Full Apache Jena feature parity — matrix + audit (planned 2026-05-01)
  - **Goal:** Structured catalog of all Jena features with OxiRS implementation status. Top 3 gaps surfaced as concrete TODO items: JenaText SPARQL, Jena Rule Language parser, Jena Assembler vocabulary.
  - **Files:** `engine/oxirs-arq/src/jena_parity/`, `engine/oxirs-arq/tests/jena_parity_test.rs`, `engine/TODO.md`, `engine/oxirs-arq/TODO.md`, `core/oxirs-core/TODO.md`.
- [x] Enterprise-grade performance (completed 2026-04-29)
- [x] Long-term support guarantees (policy: docs/policies/lts.md) (completed 2026-05-17 via RFC-001)
- [x] Comprehensive benchmarks (completed 2026-04-29)
