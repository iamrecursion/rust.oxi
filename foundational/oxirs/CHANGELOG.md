# Changelog

All notable changes to OxiRS will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.2] - Unreleased

### Changed
- **workspace**: migrated the whole RDF/XML dependency stack onto the Pure-Rust OxiXML foundation. `oxttl`, `oxrdfxml`, `oxjsonld`, `oxrdf`, `oxiri`, `oxilangtag`, `oxsdatatypes`, `json-event-parser` and `quick-xml` now resolve to `oxixml-turtle`, `oxixml-rdfxml`, `oxixml-jsonld`, `oxixml-model`, `oxixml-iri`, `oxixml-langtag`, `oxixml-xsd`, `oxixml-json` and `oxixml-quickxml-compat` via Cargo's package-rename form, so every existing `use oxrdf::…` / `use quick_xml::…` path is unchanged. `cargo tree` confirms all eight oxigraph-lineage crates have left the dependency graph, and `deny.toml` now bans them by name.
- **oxirs-core**: `oxiri` moved from 0.2 to the 0.3-shaped API — `Iri::resolve`/`resolve_unchecked` take a parsed `IriRef` rather than a string, so JSON-LD context processing and RDF/XML IRI resolution go through the new `model::iri::resolve_str{,_unchecked}` helpers.
- **oxirs-core**: JSON-LD serialization output changed shape with the replacement serializer — a bare node array with `@type` compaction, where the previous one emitted a `{"@context":…,"@graph":[…]}` envelope with full-IRI predicate keys. Byte-level comparisons against previously serialized JSON-LD will not match. Note that `JsonLdSerializer::with_prefix` and `with_base_iri` are currently accepted but have no effect on the output.
- **oxirs-core**: the JSON-LD reader parser is no longer `Send`, so `RdfParser::for_reader` drives it on a dedicated thread and streams quads back over a bounded channel. `ReaderQuadParser` keeps both its `Send` bound and its streaming behaviour.

### Security
- **oxirs-core**: dropped the RUSTSEC-2026-0194 / RUSTSEC-2026-0195 advisory ignores. Those covered a quick-xml 0.37.5 DoS reachable through `oxrdfxml`, and that crate is no longer in the graph.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-28

A workspace-wide production-readiness hardening pass: a 38-scope multi-agent audit surfaced 308 verified findings (62 P0, 131 P1, 115 P2), of which roughly 300 were fixed across 38 work packages, plus 74 test regressions caught by the full-suite gate and a follow-up chain of SPARQL-parser, storage-durability, and CLI/DID data-integrity fixes.

### Security
- **oxirs-fuseki**: closed a full authentication/authorization bypass — the `AuthUser` extractor never actually authenticated requests, `route_based_rbac` failed open, and the `/update` endpoint had no auth check at all; all three now correctly gate on `config.security.auth_required`
- **oxirs-fuseki**: X.509 client-certificate trust now verifies the certificate's signature chain instead of only comparing DN strings
- **oxirs-fuseki**: fixed a SPARQL injection vulnerability in the REST API v2 endpoints
- **oxirs-fuseki**: SPARQL `LOAD` now carries SSRF guards against internal/loopback targets
- **oxirs-gql**: the "AES" cache-encryption layer was a plaintext passthrough (data was never actually encrypted) and its token validation unconditionally granted access regardless of the token presented — both fixed
- **oxirs-did**: DID/VC verification now checks credential revocation status, consumes the auth challenge to prevent replay, and verifies ZKP selective-disclosure proofs, instead of accepting them unconditionally
- **oxirs-chat**: SAML signature verification hardened against XML Signature Wrapping attacks

### Fixed
- **oxirs-core**: the core SPARQL parser no longer silently drops `FILTER` clauses
- **oxirs-core**: `Store::flush()` now actually flushes to disk (was a no-op)
- **oxirs-embed**: KGE model save/load is now implemented (was a no-op); TransE/RotatE training loss sign corrected
- **oxirs-stream**: the NATS consumer no longer acknowledges a message before it has actually been processed
- **oxirs-shacl**: removed fabricated results from the W3C SHACL conformance test harness
- **oxirs-shacl-ai**: removed fabricated quality metrics and fabricated AutoML "training" results
- **oxirs-federate**: federated query planning now really decomposes queries instead of returning a canned plan
- **oxirs-stream**: the NATS producer now fails loud instead of silently no-op'ing on a publish failure (the Kafka producer received the same fix before that backend was removed later in this release)
- **oxirs-arq** / **oxirs-fuseki**: multi-line `CONSTRUCT`/`SELECT`/`ASK`/`DESCRIBE` queries and `UPDATE` statements (a newline before `WHERE`/braces, or a multi-`PREFIX` prologue) now parse correctly instead of failing
- **oxirs-cluster**: Raft node state (vote/log/state-machine/snapshot) is now durably persisted — a new `DurableRaftStore` fsyncs every log append and writes hard state/snapshots atomically (write-temp + fsync + rename); previously all Raft state was in-memory only, so a node restart could double-vote or lose committed writes. Resolves the durable-storage gap deferred from the 0.4.0 Raft integration
- **oxirs-cluster**: the replication-maintenance background task ran against a throwaway, empty `ReplicationManager` in a shutdown-blind infinite loop (a permanent task leak on every node); it now operates on the node's real shared manager with shutdown-aware periodic ticks
- **oxirs** (CLI): `tdbupdate` (SPARQL Update against a TDB-backed store) no longer collapses every literal/blank-node position to an IRI before writing — this silently corrupted the store for every other reader (`tdbquery`, `tdbdump`); term kind is now preserved
- **oxirs-tdb**: `repair_page_checksums` no longer re-stamps a fresh checksum over already-corrupt page bytes and reports success; it now repairs strictly from a trusted WAL redo image, or fails loud when no redo image exists
- **oxirs-tdb**: superblock reads now verify the page checksum before decoding — a crash-torn superblock page previously could be decoded anyway and silently yield wrong query results or data loss
- **oxirs-did**: `StatusList2021` credential-status encoding is now genuinely GZIP-compressed before base64url (previously plain base64url of the packed bits despite documentation claiming GZIP), fixing interoperability with external W3C-compliant verifiers
- **performance_validation**: benchmark scenarios called `sleep()` to simulate workload instead of executing real queries; they now load real datasets and run genuine end-to-end SPARQL queries
- **oxirs-fuseki**: `ServerConfig::load()` / `load_from_file()` now seed Figment with `ServerConfig::default()` before merging TOML/YAML/env, so a config file only has to state the fields it overrides; previously, since `ServerConfig`'s fields carry no `#[serde(default)]`, a file that omitted any top-level section (`datasets`, `security`, `monitoring`, `performance`, `logging`, `http_protocol`) failed to deserialize instead of falling back to that section's default
- **oxirs** (CLI): the Jena-parity checker no longer advertises the removed Kafka backend as a "beyond Jena" feature; it now lists the Confluent Schema Registry client that replaced it in the streaming category

### Added
- **oxirs-arq**: SPARQL 1.1 sub-`SELECT` (a nested `{ SELECT ... }` inside a query's `WHERE` clause) and Turtle collection (`( )`) / property-list (`[ ]`) syntax are now supported inside query patterns
- **oxirs-fuseki**: RDF-vocabulary-driven GraphQL schema auto-generation (`graphql_autoschema`), bridging discovered RDFS/OWL vocabulary into a generated GraphQL schema via oxirs-gql
- **oxirs-core**: a new mmap-able RDF store snapshot format gives sub-second cold start on reopen, versus ~13.6s re-parsing 1.35M quads from N-Quads
- **oxirs-geosparql**: the boundary-dependent Egenhofer (`ehMeet`/`ehInside`/`ehContains`) and RCC8 (`EC`/`TPP`/`TPPi`/`NTPP`/`NTPPi`) relations, plus `buffer` and `boundary`, now work in the published Pure-Rust crate — they previously returned an "requires GEOS" error unless you wired up a quarantine adapter. All three relation families and the operation functions are consequently registered in the SPARQL function registry by default
- **oxirs-geosparql**: buffering now covers every geometry type (Point, LineString, the Multi* forms, GeometryCollection) with the full OGC cap and join styles; the previous Pure-Rust path handled Polygon/MultiPolygon only
- **oxirs-stream**: `confluent_registry` — a Confluent Schema Registry REST client (register, fetch by ID or subject, compatibility checks, cached on both lookup paths). It was previously stranded inside the `publish = false` Kafka adapter despite never touching `rdkafka`; it is Pure Rust over `reqwest` and, since the Schema Registry is a standalone HTTP service, works with no broker at all. Distinct from `schema_registry`, which validates events against locally-held schemas

### Changed
- **oxirs-tauri**: the desktop app has real icons. `tauri-build` requires `icons/icon.ico` on Windows to emit the Windows Resource file, and only a 32x32 solid-colour placeholder `icon.png` was committed — so the crate could not build on Windows at all, which broke `cargo check --all-features` for the entire workspace. Both icons are now generated from one description by `icons/generate_icons.py` (an RDF-triple mark in the palette `ui/styles.css` defines), each ICO frame rendered at its own size so the 16px variant stays legible
- **oxirs-fuseki** / **oxirs-arq**: the SPARQL query path is unified onto the real oxirs-arq execution engine
- **oxirs-cluster**: state-machine checkpointing is now durable and amortized O(1) (was O(n²))
- **oxirs-star**: tiered-storage default directories are now instance-unique, fixing a cross-process data-leakage bug where concurrent instances could share the same on-disk location
- **oxirs-core**: the `blas` Cargo feature previously compiled but had no effect; it now wires into real OxiBLAS linear-algebra routines
- **oxirs-vec**: HNSW graph construction is significantly faster — `select_neighbors_heuristic` now maintains the running minimum distance-to-selected incrementally instead of recomputing it from scratch every round (O(M × candidates) distance evaluations instead of O(M² × candidates), identical selected-node output), and `calculate_distance_between_nodes` uses a new `SimilarityMetric::distance_slices` over each node's cached `vector_data_f32` instead of `distance()`, which reallocated a fresh `Vec<f32>` per call via `Vector::as_f32()`; both sat in construction's hottest loop
- **oxirs-vec**: the Linux NUMA allocator (`mmap_advanced`) is reimplemented in Pure Rust — topology discovery reads sysfs (`/sys/devices/system/node`, `/sys/devices/system/cpu`) directly and memory-policy binding goes through the raw `mbind(2)` syscall via `libc::syscall`, replacing `extern "C"` bindings to `libnuma` (`numa_available`/`numa_max_node`/`numa_node_of_cpu`/`numa_alloc_onnode`/`numa_free`/`mbind`) that required linking a system library, consistent with the COOLJAPAN Pure Rust Policy. CUDA detection/linking is also dropped from oxirs-vec itself (real CUDA acceleration lives in the quarantined `oxirs-vec-adapter-cuda` crate), so `build.rs` is deleted entirely — the crate no longer needs a build script at all
- **oxirs** (CLI): the `all-features` Cargo feature (which silently omitted `excel-export` and `system-keyring`) has been renamed to `full-cli` and now genuinely enables every optional CLI feature; build scripts referencing `--features all-features` must switch to `--features full-cli`
- COOLJAPAN ecosystem: `scirs2-*` 0.6.1 → 0.6.4; `oxigdal-proj` renamed to `oxigeo-proj` (0.1.7 → 0.2.1, two bumps: the rename+major jump to 0.2.0, then a follow-up patch to 0.2.1); new Pure-Rust `oxiarc-bzip2` dependency
- **oxirs-stream**: the `sparkplug` feature's build script now compiles `sparkplug_b.proto` with `oxiproto-build` (COOLJAPAN OxiProto) instead of `prost-build`, removing the requirement for a separately installed `protoc` executable. The generated types are unchanged — OxiProto parses `.proto` in pure Rust and delegates codegen to the same prost-build version

### Removed
- **oxirs-geosparql**: the `oxirs-geosparql-adapter-geos` quarantine crate and the `rust-buffer` Cargo feature are both gone, along with the `geo-buffer` dependency. `geo::algorithm::buffer` (backed by `i_overlay`) replaces both, so buffering is unconditional Pure Rust with no C library and no opt-in. `buffer_rust` is removed — call `buffer`, which now handles what it did and more. **Breaking** for anyone passing `--features rust-buffer` or depending on the adapter crate
- **oxirs-tsdb** / **oxirs** (CLI): the `oxirs-tsdb-adapter-duckdb` quarantine crate, the CLI's `tsdb-duckdb` feature, and the `oxirs tsdb duckdb` subcommand are removed with no replacement. Export chunks to Parquet via oxirs-tsdb's `arrow-export` feature and query them with an external DuckDB; the Pure-Rust `analytics::DuckDbQueryAdapter` still builds the SQL for that. **Breaking** for anyone using that subcommand
- **oxirs-stream**: the Kafka backend is removed — the `oxirs-stream-adapter-rdkafka` quarantine crate, the `StreamBackendType::Kafka` config variant, and the unreferenced in-tree `backend::kafka_backup` module (744 lines that no `mod` declaration ever pulled in). Quarantining it in 0.3.2 had already made it unreachable: the adapter was `publish = false`, so no crates.io release could use it, and `StreamProducer::new`/`StreamConsumer::new` returned an error for a `Kafka` config. It also required a C toolchain (`librdkafka` via `rdkafka-sys`, plus `libz-sys`), which is what kept `cargo build --all-features` from working on a plain Windows checkout. A config variant that parses but can never connect is worse than no variant, so it is gone rather than deprecated; `OXIRS_BACKEND=kafka` now fails with an explanatory error instead of silently falling through. Use `nats`, `redis`, `rabbitmq`, `mqtt`, or `memory`. **Breaking** for anyone constructing `StreamBackendType::Kafka`

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-19

This release consolidates the 0.3.3 production-hardening work (a 272-finding audit that landed 288 fixes and 455 regression tests across storage, security, and distributed subsystems) with the 0.3.4 deployment fixes surfaced by the public, query-only sparql.wik.jp rollout. Neither 0.3.3 nor 0.3.4 was published to crates.io; both are shipped here as 0.4.0.

### Added
- **oxirs-tdb**: real durable on-disk backend — a superblock (v2, with quad roots), fsync-backed writes, a free-page allocator, GSPO/GPOS/GOSP quad and named-graph indexes, and streaming quad iterators; reopen round-trips are verified against a 10k-quad multigraph. Replaces the previous non-persisting placeholder
- **oxirs-fuseki**: `StoreType::TDB2` / `dataset_type = "tdb2"` now opens a real on-disk store via a new `TdbStoreAdapter` + `StoreFactory` (`store/{tdb_adapter.rs,store_factory.rs}`); the adapter implements `oxirs_core::Store` over `TdbStore` and does bidirectional conversion between oxirs-core terms and oxirs-tdb's own `Term` type. Unknown dataset types now fail loud instead of silently falling back to in-memory
- **oxirs**: `oxirs import --dataset-type tdb2` bulk-loads to disk with bounded RAM (validated on the wik.jp 8M+ triple corpus); tdb2 datasets are detected by a `data.tdb` marker file in the dataset directory
- **oxirs-core**: `Store` trait gained streaming `bulk_insert_quads` and `for_each_quad` methods (default impls); oxirs-fuseki's Graph Store Protocol GET now streams the graph instead of materializing it
- **oxirs-core**: new public `RdfStore` durability API — `RdfStore::{open_with_sync_policy, flush}`, the `SyncPolicy` enum, `PersistentState`, and `AsyncRdfStore::flush_async`
- **oxirs-arq**: new `graph_result` module backing `CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` execution — `instantiate_construct` (per-row blank-node scoping, ill-formed-triple skipping, cross-row dedup) and `describe` (subject-rooted, blank-node-closure, cycle-safe Concise Bounded Description), covering `DESCRIBE <iri>` with no `WHERE`, `DESCRIBE *`, and the `CONSTRUCT WHERE {}` shorthand
- **oxirs-core**: `Store::named_graphs` gained a trait-level override so named-graph enumeration is O(graphs) instead of a full O(triples) scan; backs the new `FROM`/`FROM NAMED` dataset views
- **oxirs-cluster**, **oxirs-embed**, **oxirs-chat**: each gained a router-construction regression test that builds the crate's real axum `Router` and asserts construction does not panic (see axum 0.8 migration under Fixed)
- New test suites: `oxirs-arq/tests/bind_scoping_test.rs` (9 cases, BIND positional scoping) and `oxirs-arq/tests/parser_forms_test.rs` (23 cases, SELECT/DESCRIBE/CONSTRUCT/aggregate parser forms); `oxirs-fuseki/tests/query_path_040.rs` (20 cases, end-to-end through the real `ServerBuilder`/production `build_app` router)
- Workspace: `oxirs-chat` added to `[workspace.dependencies]`; `oxirs-tauri` now consumes it via `oxirs-chat.workspace = true` (was pinned to a literal path/version pair that broke dependency resolution on the last version bump)
- **oxirs-arq**: `DESCRIBE` now returns a **symmetric** Concise Bounded Description (`graph_result::describe`) — both the described node's outgoing arcs (`node ?p ?o`) and its incoming/object-side arcs (`?s ?p node`), with blank-node closure followed in both directions and a visited-set so cycles terminate; `FROM`/`FROM NAMED` scoping is honored end to end (an object-only resource is now described via its incoming arc instead of to an empty graph). Auto-unioning every named graph for an unscoped `DESCRIBE` is a documented deliberate non-goal
- **oxirs-tdb**: WAL-integrated durable writes (F3) — every mutating op logs Begin/Update/Commit through an fsync-ordered write-ahead log, recovery replays committed operations on open (`recover_from_wal`), a checkpoint LSN is recorded in the superblock, and `sync()` orders WAL flush → page flush → superblock → WAL truncate; `TdbConfig.enable_wal` defaults to `true`. A crash test (`test_crash_without_sync_replays_committed_writes`) proves committed-but-unsynced writes survive a reopen
- **oxirs-tdb**: sorted bulk build (F6) — `insert_triples_bulk`/`insert_quads_bulk` intern and encode a whole batch, validate it up front (literal-subject / quads-disabled fail loudly *before* any mutation), do a per-index sorted construction (SPO/POS/OSP and GSPO/GPOS/GOSP), and issue one WAL batch + one sync per batch; both callers (`tdbloader`, the fuseki TDB adapter) are routed to it. `StoreParams` is now honored end to end via `open_with_params` → `TdbConfig::from_store_params` (buffer pool, bloom fpr/size, query cache, statistics sampling, slow-query/timeout monitors, spatial index, quad indexes, WAL); a `page_size` other than the compile-time page size is rejected loudly. Opt-in unix direct I/O (`enable_direct_io`: Linux `O_DIRECT`, macOS `F_NOCACHE` via `fcntl`, failing loud on error); the default path is plain `std::fs`
- **oxirs** (CLI): new subcommands — `lint` (Turtle/RDF issue scanner: empty/undeclared prefixes, duplicate triples, over-long literals, deprecated predicates), `merge` (set-union with blank-node renaming, conflict detection, optional provenance), `jena-parity` (OxiRS-vs-Apache-Jena feature-parity report), `monitor` (polls a **remote** SPARQL endpoint for latency/uptime/P95 over HTTP, distinct from `performance monitor`'s local sampling), `detect-format` (RDF format detection by extension, content, and magic bytes with a confidence score), and `inspect` (consolidated data profiler: triple/subject/predicate counts, namespaces, top predicates/classes, connectivity, object-type distribution, and data-quality checks over a real file). Also: `serve --dry-run` (validate config + report the bind address without opening any socket), `schema-gen --advanced` (subclass-hierarchy / domain-range / cardinality inference emitting OWL/RDFS), `history export-csv` and `history similar` (query-similarity ranking), and `profile … --flamegraph <svg>` (SVG flamegraph output). The interactive REPL gains meta-commands `:bookmark`, `:export`, `:diagram`, `:dataset`, `:visual`, and `:hsearch`, plus schema-aware completion
- **oxirs** (CLI): transparent `.gz` I/O — `import`, `riot`, and `rdfcat` inflate gzipped inputs on the fly (the RDF format is detected from the inner name, so `data.ttl.gz` parses as Turtle), `riot` gzip-compresses when `--output` ends in `.gz`, and `tdbbackup` now writes a genuine gzip archive and restores it by magic-byte sniffing (legacy uncompressed archives still restore); everything routes through a single `oxiarc-deflate`-backed gzip path, and corrupt gzip input is an explicit fail-loud error, never fabricated content

### Changed
- **oxirs-core**: `RdfStore` Persistent backend rewritten — the per-insert full-file rewrite (O(N²)) is replaced by a single N-Quads line appended through a buffered writer (`Mutex<BufWriter>`), turning a 100k-triple insert from quadratic into ~7.4s; `remove`/`clear` now set a dirty flag and `flush()`/`Drop` compacts atomically (temp file + `sync_all` + `rename`). `StorageBackend::Persistent`'s second field is now `Arc<PersistentState>` (was a `PathBuf`) and `StorageBackend` derives `Clone`
- **oxirs-core**: `MemoryStorage` now interns terms (a term→`u32` dictionary) behind four ID-based `BTreeSet<[u32;4]>` index permutations (SPOG/POSG/OSPG/GSPO), cutting per-triple RAM roughly 4x
- **oxirs-arq**: experimental cognitive modules (consciousness/quantum/molecular) are gated behind a non-default `experimental-ai` feature and no longer build by default
- COOLJAPAN ecosystem: `oxiarc-{archive,brotli,deflate,lz4,lzma,snappy,zstd}` 0.3.5 → 0.3.6; `oxicrypto-{core,aead,rand,mac,hash,kdf}` 0.2.0 → 0.2.1; `oxisql-core`/`oxisql-sqlite-compat` 0.3.2 → 0.3.3; `oxitls`/`oxitls-rcgen` 0.2.0 → 0.2.1; `scirs2-{core,linalg,stats,neural,graph,integrate}` 0.6.0 → 0.6.1
- **oxirs-fuseki**: `GET /$/stats` now returns merged dataset+runtime statistics — the 0.3.4 axum-0.8 route deduplication (commit 7b32c39f) had dropped the `uptime_seconds`/`total_requests`/`memory_usage_mb`/`cpu_usage_percent`/`active_connections` runtime fields when removing the overlapping duplicate route registration; they are now nested under a new `"runtime"` key alongside the existing dataset/triple statistics (additive change, existing fields unchanged)
- **oxirs-fuseki** / **oxirs-arq**: the SPARQL query path is now unified through a single parse-once dispatch in `arq_exec.rs` — `SELECT`/`ASK`/`CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` all execute via the real oxirs-arq engine instead of substring-based query-type routing; `GRAPH <iri>`/`GRAPH ?g` execute for real in both the serial and the parallel executor, `FROM`/`FROM NAMED` are honored via dataset views, and `SERVICE` HTTP federation is reachable end-to-end from the SPARQL protocol endpoint. Native aggregate projections (`COUNT`/`SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`AVG`/`SAMPLE`/`GROUP_CONCAT` with `SEPARATOR`, expressions inside aggregates such as `SUM(?a*?b)`, `DISTINCT`) and `HAVING` (including aggregate calls inside `HAVING`) now run through the engine's own grouping machinery. The legacy demo query path and every silent-empty-200 fallback are deleted — parse failures are HTTP 400, execution failures HTTP 500, never a silent empty 200
- **oxirs-cluster**, **oxirs-embed**, **oxirs-chat**: HTTP routes migrated to axum 0.8/matchit 0.8 path syntax (`:param`/`*wildcard` → `{param}`/`{*wildcard}`) across 3, 4, and 8 routes respectively (oxirs-chat's include multi-parameter routes such as `/api/sessions/{session_id}/threads/{thread_id}/messages`) — completing, workspace-wide, the route migration that shipped fuseki-only in 0.3.4
- **oxirs-star**: `StarStore::query()` with a bound subject/predicate/object now delegates to the core store's indexed `find_quads` lookup instead of dumping every triple in the store (via `all_triples()`) and re-filtering it on every call — a significant lookup-cost fix for any store beyond a trivial size; quoted-triple data that reaches the core store from outside `StarStore::insert()`'s own routing (unsupported by `StarStore`'s core→star conversion) is now logged with a `warn!` skipped-count instead of being silently and untraceably dropped from read results
- **oxirs-rule**: `ForwardChainer::infer()` now uses semi-naive evaluation — facts are indexed by predicate, and each iteration joins the rule body only against the *delta* of facts newly derived in the previous round (the first round is seeded with the full fact set) instead of re-deriving over the entire accumulated fact set on every iteration — reaching the identical least fixpoint while avoiding the previous naive algorithm's `O(rules × facts × iterations)` blow-up on deep/recursive rule sets such as transitive closures
- **oxirs-graphrag**: entity-mention linking (`entity_linker::EntityLinker` and the separate `entity_linking::EntityLinker`) no longer scores every knowledge-base entity per mention — `detect_mentions` now walks the input text once and hash-probes a label index bounded by the longest indexed label instead of re-scanning the whole text once per indexed label (`O(text length × longest label)`, independent of vocabulary size), and `link_mention`/`candidate_generation` now use a first-character blocking index (a standard record-linkage technique) so only entities sharing a mention's leading character are scored via edit-distance/Jaro-Winkler similarity, instead of the entire knowledge base

### Fixed
- **oxirs-core**: a new IRI/literal-aware SPARQL query locator fixes `ASK { }` and `SELECT * { }` (WHERE keyword omitted) extracting zero patterns
- **oxirs-arq**: parser now accepts `SELECT *` (it had matched the never-emitted `Token::Multiply` rather than the `Token::Star` the tokenizer produces), an optional-WHERE `ASK { … }`, and group-scoped `FILTER`/`BIND` (a bare `FILTER` was JOINed against an empty binding and silently dropped every row); `SERVICE` now performs real HTTP federation (was querying local data); `UPDATE … WHERE` executes against the real store (was fabricated `example.org` constants); serial-executor `GRAPH`/`HAVING`/`SERVICE` no longer return silently empty; grace hash-join spill fixed
- **oxirs-arq**: `BIND` is now scoped positionally per SPARQL §18.2.2 — `BIND(expr AS ?v)` extends only the solution built from the elements written *before* it in the same group; the string parser previously deferred every `BIND` to the group's end (treating it like a whole-group `FILTER`), which silently produced wrong bindings whenever a `BIND` was followed by more graph patterns in the same group
- **oxirs-arq**: a `FILTER` written after a top-level `UNION` is now scoped to its enclosing group instead of leaking past it
- **oxirs-arq**: `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` expression lists now actually populate through the string-based parser — the tokenizer emits both the `GROUP`/`ORDER` keyword and the trailing `BY` as separate tokens, and the modifier reader was treating that trailing `BY` as the start of the next clause, silently dropping both lists; fixed by consuming the standalone `BY` token before reading the expression list
- **oxirs-arq**: `DESCRIBE` targets are now retained through parsing (previously dropped); added dedicated `SELECT *` regression coverage
- **oxirs-fuseki**: SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE queries now route through the real oxirs-arq executor via a single parse-once dispatch in the new `handlers/sparql/arq_exec.rs` (zero-copy `StoreRefDataset`), instead of a demo parser that dropped `FILTER`, never parsed `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`/aggregates, and returned 200 OK with an empty body on any parse/execution failure; parse failures are now HTTP 400 and execution failures HTTP 500, never a silent empty result
- **oxirs-fuseki**: SPARQL UPDATE now dispatches on the parsed oxirs-arq AST instead of a substring `.contains("CLEAR")` scan over the whole query text — an `INSERT DATA` whose literal contained "clear" previously wiped the default graph
- **oxirs-fuseki**: `INSERT DATA`/`DELETE DATA` blocks now parse every triple — `parse_data_block` splits statements on top-level `.` terminators (ignoring `.` inside IRIs, quoted literals, and `#` comments) and aborts the whole block on any malformed statement, rather than parsing one triple per physical line and dropping the rest as a zero-row "success"
- **oxirs-fuseki**: HTTP routes migrated to axum 0.8 (`matchit` 0.8) path syntax — legacy `:param`/`*wildcard` captures rewritten to `{param}`/`{*wildcard}` across 17+ routes, and two overlapping duplicate method-route registrations removed; the server previously panicked at router construction before it could bind its port
- **oxirs-vec**: TF-IDF now uses smoothed IDF `ln((1+N)/(1+df)) + 1` (the previous form collapsed to 0 when `df = N-1`); FAISS HNSW/IVF read paths now consume exactly the bytes the writer emitted, fixing a cursor misalignment that corrupted deserialized vectors
- **oxirs-samm**: graph analytics short-circuits `density = 0` for `n < 2` instead of propagating an error
- **oxirs-arq**: aggregate arity inside a `HAVING` condition is now validated at parse time — `SUM()`, `COUNT(?a, ?b)`, and other wrong-arity aggregate calls fail as an HTTP 400 parse error through the shared `check_aggregate_arity` helper (`COUNT` accepts 0 or 1 argument, every other aggregate exactly one), so the parser and executor reject identically; previously such a call parsed cleanly and only failed deep in execution, surfacing as a 500
- **oxirs-arq**: an unknown function in a `FILTER`/`HAVING` now raises a typed `UnknownFunctionError` that fails the whole query loudly, instead of being caught per-row and silently shrinking the result set (was a 200 with dropped rows)
- **oxirs-fuseki**: SPARQL Results JSON term serialization (`arq_exec::term_to_json`) is now exhaustive over the arq term type — an RDF-star `QuotedTriple` serializes as `{"type":"triple","value":{subject,predicate,object}}` (recursing per position), and a `PropertyPath` in binding position is a 500 fail-loud error rather than a fabricated `Debug`-string literal; the dead, divergent `convert_term_to_json` island in `handlers/sparql/core.rs` was deleted and a stale line-number comment corrected
- **oxirs** (CLI): `generate --schema <file>` now actually parses the supplied SHACL/RDFS/OWL schema and generates data conforming to it (dispatching to real `from_shacl`/`from_rdfs`/`from_owl` parsers, failing loud on a missing file or a schema with no classes) — previously it emitted hardcoded `example.org` sample data regardless of the schema file, an honesty bug
- **oxirs** (CLI): over two dozen dead, simulated, and duplicate command modules removed — fake in-memory transaction simulators, simulated SHACL validation, and simulated query/benchmark runners among them — so every remaining subcommand runs against real data through the real engine rather than a stub
- **oxirs-core**: term-dictionary ids are now reference-counted with a free-list (`rdf_store/dictionary.rs`), so deleting a term reclaims its interned id immediately for reuse instead of leaking it until compaction; the legacy `sparql::query_locator` WHERE scanner is now `#`-line-comment aware, so a `#`-commented brace or keyword no longer misplaces the WHERE group
- **oxirs-gql**: the GraphQL schema auto-generated from a store's RDF vocabulary (`SchemaGenerator`) now actually resolves against real data — a new `AutoSchemaResolver` runs bounded SPARQL queries per generated collection/by-id field and per-instance property, resolving object-typed properties one level deep; previously the generated fields were reachable only from the generator's own unit tests and returned nothing when queried against a live store. The server binary's `--graphiql` flag previously just printed "planned for future release"; a new `--use-juniper` flag now switches the binary to the pre-existing Juniper/Hyper server implementation, which honors `--graphiql` for real
- **oxirs-tsdb**: hybrid SPARQL/time-series queries now actually join their two result sets — `QueryRouter::merge_results` previously took the time-series solutions as an unused parameter and discarded them entirely; RDF and time-series bindings are now merged on shared variable names with standard SPARQL join semantics (a row survives only if every shared variable agrees)
- **oxirs-federate**: `ServiceRegistry::refresh_capabilities` (backing `FederationEngine::discover_services()`) was a disabled no-op; it now re-runs live SPARQL Service Description and GraphQL introspection probing against every registered service and updates the registry in place, tolerating individual unreachable services without aborting the whole refresh. `NetworkOptimizer`'s per-service latency/packet-loss/bandwidth estimates are now derived from real timed HEAD-probe rounds instead of fabricated numbers
- **oxirs-stream**: the event-sourcing `EventStore`'s `FileSystem` persistence backend was a pure no-op (a `sleep()` plus a fake byte-counter bump) — no event or snapshot was ever actually written to disk; it now writes real fsync-flushed JSON-lines and reloads previously persisted events/snapshots on construction ("load-on-open") so a restart no longer silently drops durable history. Multi-region replication's `FirstWriteWins` and `RegionPriority` conflict-resolution strategies were both silently discarded by the same catch-all match arm (configuring either had no effect whatsoever); both now actually resolve the conflict
- **oxirs-ttl**: the line-based N3 parser treated *any* line containing `=` as a rule/implication and silently dropped it — including ordinary data such as an IRI with a query string (`?a=b&c=d`); the parallel parser could also corrupt or silently drop a multi-line, semicolon-continued statement that happened to land on a raw line-based chunk boundary. Both are fixed by a new shared `statement_boundary` module (string/long-string-aware top-level-statement-boundary scanning) used by both the parallel and incremental parsers
- **oxirs-star**: SHACL-star `Cardinality` constraints are now actually evaluated — real occurrences of the constrained property on the triple's subject are counted and compared against the configured min/max bounds — instead of being unconditionally skipped (every shape carrying a cardinality constraint previously reported PASS regardless of the underlying data); `ConstraintType::Custom` constraints are now rejected with an error both at `ShaclStarShape::add_constraint()` time and defensively during `validate()`, since no custom-validator callback registry exists yet, instead of being silently accepted and then silently skipped during validation. `FederatedQueryExecutor::execute_federated` likewise now fails loudly — an unregistered endpoint is a configuration error, and a registered one returns a clear "not implemented; use oxirs-arq's `service_federation`" error — instead of silently returning `Ok(vec![])`, a fabricated "successful" empty result indistinguishable from a genuinely empty remote graph
- **oxirs-star**: the JIT query engine's interpreted execution mode now actually parses the SPARQL-star query text and runs it through the crate's real BGP query executor, returning only the triples that satisfy the WHERE clause — previously it ignored the query text entirely and returned the whole store regardless of what was asked. Once a query is marked "compiled" (its kernel ID is cached), `JitQueryEngine::execute()` now falls back to interpreted execution when compiled-kernel execution errors — which it always does today, since kernel execution is not yet wired to `scirs2_core::jit::execute_kernel` — instead of that query failing outright on every subsequent call once it became "hot" enough to compile
- **oxirs-star**: several `StarStore` methods that previously only simulated their documented behavior now do the real thing — `compute_pattern_results()` parses N-Triples-style `SUBJECT PREDICATE OBJECT` patterns (IRIs, blank nodes, `"literal"@lang`/`^^<datatype>`, `?` wildcards) and runs them through the indexed `query()`, instead of returning either a nesting-depth scan or literally the entire store for any pattern not equal to the bare keyword `"quoted"`; `compress_storage()` now actually serializes (`oxicode`) and compresses (`oxiarc-zstd`) the store's data and returns the real measured byte savings, instead of a fabricated `triple_count * 50` estimate; and `enable_memory_mapping()` now fails loudly (no on-disk/mmap-backed representation exists for the in-memory `StarStore`) instead of silently flipping an `enabled` flag while keeping all data fully resident in RAM. Separately, `bulk_insert_parallel`'s chunk-size computation no longer panics via `.chunks(0)` when `worker_threads` exceeds the number of triples being inserted
- **oxirs-star**: `ReificationBridge::reification_to_star` now propagates `insert()` validation failures instead of silently discarding them (`let _ = ...`) — a reified statement that reconstructs into an invalid base triple (e.g. a literal value in the predicate position) now surfaces as an error instead of silently vanishing from the converted graph; `BulkInsertConfig`'s default `worker_threads` is now derived from `std::thread::available_parallelism()` (capped at 8) instead of the dead expression `std::cmp::min(8, 4)`, which always evaluated to 4 regardless of the machine's actual core count; and unconditional `eprintln!` debug-spam on every `insert()`/`remove()` call has been removed
- **oxirs-wasm**: the in-memory SPARQL executor's `FILTER(regex(?var, "pattern"))` now evaluates with a real `regex` engine (newly added workspace dependency) instead of a `text.contains(pattern)` substring-match stub; and any FILTER expression the lightweight parser cannot translate into a supported form (regex or string equality) now fails query execution with a parse error instead of silently admitting every row — previously an unsupported or unparseable FILTER (e.g. `FILTER(?age > "18")`) was treated as an always-true no-op, making results look filtered when every row was actually passing through unfiltered
- **oxirs-samm**: `ModelGraph::compute_metrics()`'s `diameter` is now a real computed value — the longest weighted shortest path between any pair of distinct, mutually-reachable nodes, via repeated Dijkstra queries — instead of a hardcoded `0.0` returned unconditionally regardless of graph shape
- **oxirs-samm**: `GcsBackend::new()` (via `GcsConfig::validate()`) now rejects a config that supplies only a `service_account_key` with no `access_token` at construction time, since oxirs-samm has no JWT/OAuth2 service-account token-exchange implementation to turn that key into a usable bearer token — previously such a config was accepted and would only fail later, at first-request time, with a much harder to diagnose error
- **oxirs-rule**: `RuleEngine::add_rule()` now logs a warning when the RETE network rejects a rule it cannot compile, instead of silently discarding the failure — previously a rejected rule would silently vanish from `rete_forward_chain()`'s results while still applying normally in `forward_chain()`/`backward_chain()`, with no signal that the two engines had diverged on that rule
- **oxirs-rule**: `TransactionManager` (`transaction.rs`) and `RuleIndex` (`rule_index_store.rs`) no longer panic via `.expect("lock poisoned")` when a shared mutex/rwlock is poisoned by a prior panic on another thread — every lock acquisition now recovers the poisoned guard's data instead, so one panicking thread no longer cascades into every subsequent transaction or rule-index operation also panicking
- **oxirs-shacl-ai**: `ShapeLearner`'s shape-learning pipeline now derives shapes from real RDF data instead of fabricated samples — `discover_classes` scans the store's actual `rdf:type` usage and returns distinct classes ranked by instance count, instead of always returning a single hardcoded `http://example.org/DefaultClass`; `discover_patterns_for_class` samples up to `max_sample_instances` (default 2000) real instances of a class and computes genuine per-property usage/datatype/cardinality statistics, instead of fabricating three fixed sample patterns regardless of the class or its actual data; and `patterns_to_shape` now attaches those statistics as real generated `sh:property` shapes carrying `sh:minCount`/`sh:maxCount`/`sh:datatype` constraints, linked into the returned node shape — previously constraint attachment was only a debug-log message ("in real implementation, this would add actual SHACL constraints") that discarded every discovered pattern, so every "learned" shape carried nothing but a bare `sh:targetClass`

### Security
- **oxirs-did**: real X25519 ECDH (was an XOR placeholder) and real Ristretto Schnorr/Pedersen commitments (were forgeable); the Mock KMS is moved behind a non-default `insecure-mock-kms` feature and removed from the crate root
- **oxirs-chat**: SSO now verifies OIDC ID tokens (RS256/ES256 via JWKS) and SAML XML signatures, failing closed
- **oxirs-cluster**: inter-node RPC is now real length-prefixed, oxicode-framed TCP (was a no-op that fabricated `Vote`/`AppendEntries` responses); health-check RPC is real; BFT waits for a real 2f+1 quorum; checkpoints do real disk I/O; multi-node raft and cloud discovery now fail loud when unavailable instead of faking a single-node leader
- **oxirs-cluster**: BFT consensus (feature `bft`) is now a closed loop — `handle_commit` is idempotent (extra commits past quorum never re-execute), `execute_operation` deserializes and applies the real `RdfCommand` to the storage backend and returns a real `RdfResponse` (was a fabricated JSON hash blob), a manager-side commit callback keyed on `(client_id, timestamp)` lets `process_request` complete on a genuine 2f+1 quorum instead of always timing out, `broadcast_message` is wired to the real authenticated `BftNetworkService` (was a no-op), `NodeConfig.use_bft` is honored (fail-loud when the `bft` feature is off), the commit timeout is configurable, and an end-to-end quorum test proves the storage apply
- **oxirs-fuseki**: `read_only` datasets are now enforced on the SPARQL update, Graph Store Protocol (PUT/POST/DELETE), file upload, and RDF Patch write paths — the loaded `ServerConfig` is threaded through a new `ServerBuilder::config()` into `AppState`, and `AppState::is_dataset_read_only()` rejects writes with HTTP 403 before any mutation; previously the config-loaded `read_only` flag never reached `AppState` and only the UPDATE path checked it, so writes were silently applied. `is_dataset_read_only()` now also resolves name-agnostically when **exactly one** dataset is configured — any dataset name gets write protection, not only one literally named `"default"` — while startup diagnostics emit a WARN whenever multiple datasets are configured with at least one `read_only`, escalating to ERROR when none of those read_only datasets is named `"default"` (the literal key the name-keyed guards — Graph Store Protocol, upload, patch, `/$/reload` — resolve against once a *second* dataset exists). A shared `AppState::reject_if_read_only()` helper now backs every write guard, newly including the admin dataset create/delete/compact/reload endpoints (`handlers/admin.rs`) and the REST API v2 dataset/triple write endpoints (`rest_api_v2.rs`) — the latter had previously been a completely unguarded write bypass around the read_only check. Regression tests drive the real `ServerBuilder` and the production `build_app` router rather than a hand-rolled test harness
- **oxirs-gql**: the auto-generated schema's raw `sparql(query: String!): String` passthrough field — which bypasses all GraphQL-level depth/complexity limits and runs arbitrary SPARQL with no authentication of its own — was previously always present on the generated schema; it is now opt-in via `GraphQLConfig`/`SchemaGenerationConfig`'s `enable_sparql_field` (`false` by default) and carries its own 30s query timeout. The standalone server also gained header-size, body-size, and concurrent-connection caps plus a per-read timeout (Slowloris protection), and now wires in its previously-unreferenced `rate_limiting::RateLimiter`

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **oxirs-core**: new `encoding` module — pure-`std` RFC 3986 percent-encoding (`percent_encode`, `percent_encode_strict`, `percent_decode`), replacing the external `urlencoding` crate; now backs SPARQL's `ENCODE_FOR_URI()` and oxirs-fuseki's OAuth2/SAML/LDF URL handling
- **oxirs-shacl**: `advanced_features::subclass_closure` — reflexive+transitive `rdfs:subClassOf` closure (Floyd–Warshall over a boolean adjacency matrix); `sh:class` and implicit-class targets now honor subclassing instead of exact-type matching only
- **oxirs-shacl**: SPARQL-based (`sh:target` SPARQLTarget) and single-hop property-path targets now execute for real against the store, replacing stub implementations that returned empty or unchanged results
- **oxirs-vec**: `real_time_embedding_pipeline` gains a full consistency/versioning/monitoring stack — `consistency` (inconsistency repair engine with severity-based outcomes), `versioning` (per-ID embedding version history with configurable retention), and a rewritten `monitoring` (metrics collection, health checks, severity-throttled alerting); all four submodules (`consistency`, `versioning`, `monitoring`, `coordination`) are now compiled and wired live into `RealTimeEmbeddingPipeline` — previously declared but commented out as unimplemented
- **oxirs-chat**: `nl2sparql::context_aware` — `extract_entities_rich()` rule-based NL entity extraction returning typed, span-and-confidence-scored `ExtractedEntity` values (IRIs, prefixed names, quoted literals, multi-word capitalized concepts)
- **oxirs-stream**: MQTT 5.0 property codec (`backend::mqtt::properties`) — encode/decode for the PUBLISH-relevant property set (Payload Format Indicator, Message Expiry Interval, Content Type, Response Topic, Correlation Data, Subscription Identifier, Topic Alias, repeatable User Properties), wired into `MqttClient::parse_properties_from_bytes()`
- **oxirs-federate**: NATS federation now dispatches inbound messages to registered `FederationMessageHandler`s by type (`register_handler()`), replacing a no-op stub
- **oxirs-gql**: adaptive query batching (`QueryBatcher::analyze_batch_dependencies()` plus topological wave execution), an activated ML-driven `DynamicQueryPlanner` (real `MLQueryOptimizer` + `PerformanceTracker` behind `enable_ml_prediction`), and real parallel-field-resolver timing metrics — all previously dead or stubbed code paths
- **oxirs-tdb**: saga steps now run real registered forward-action/compensation callbacks (`SagaCallbackRegistry`) with reverse-order compensation on failure; 2PC/3PC participants can now commit/abort a real WAL-backed `Transaction` via `with_transaction_manager()`; the deadlock detector's `LeastWork` victim-selection strategy is implemented instead of silently falling back
- **oxirs-geosparql**: shapefile writer now emits interior rings (holes) for `Polygon`/`MultiPolygon`; WKT parser accepts optional Z/M coordinate dimensions; `GeoPackage::checkpoint()` for explicit WAL flush
- **oxirs-wasm**: SPARQL queries may declare a `PREFIX`/`BASE` prologue (`query::prefix_expand::expand_prologue`), expanded before parsing; a per-store solution budget (`setSolutionBudget`/`clearSolutionBudget`) fails a query fast once a join produces more intermediate rows than configured, instead of running an unselective join to completion

### Added — Pure-Rust Policy v2 (COOLJAPAN)
- Six previously in-tree, feature-gated C-FFI integrations were extracted into new `publish = false` adapter crates, each reusing the original crate's public types so the two stay API-compatible:
  - **oxirs-gpu-monitor**: `NvmlGpuMonitor` — live NVIDIA GPU telemetry (utilization, memory, temperature, power draw) via NVML
  - **oxirs-vec-adapter-cuda**: `CudaBuffer`/`CudaStream`/`CudaKernel` and device enumeration, backed by `cuda-runtime-sys`
  - **oxirs-geosparql-adapter-geos**: GEOS-backed Egenhofer relations, RCC8 relations, and buffer/boundary operations
  - **oxirs-tsdb-adapter-duckdb**: Arrow `RecordBatch` bridge between DuckDB SQL and `oxirs_tsdb::TimeChunk`/`DataPoint`
  - **oxirs-stream-adapter-rdkafka**: the former in-tree Kafka backend (consumer, producer, schema registry), moved verbatim
  - **oxirs-stream-adapter-pulsar**: the former in-tree Pulsar backend, moved verbatim
- New internal `crates/zstd-shim`, redirected to via workspace-wide `[patch.crates-io] zstd = ...`: a Pure-Rust shim backed by `oxiarc-zstd` that replaces the C-FFI `zstd`/`zstd-sys` crate for every transitive consumer (tantivy, parquet, pulsar, wasmtime) — removes the last transitive `zstd-sys` C dependency from the default build

### Changed
- **oxirs-geosparql**: `GeoPackage`'s SQLite backend migrated from `rusqlite` (bundled C libsqlite3) to Pure-Rust `oxisql-core`/`oxisql-sqlite-compat`
- **oxirs-arq**: removed the `ordered-float` dependency; float-valued SPARQL terms now use in-house `TotalF32`/`TotalF64` total-order wrappers (`total_float.rs`) with identical NaN-equality and zero-sign semantics
- **oxirs-wasm**: triple pattern and property-path evaluation now drives off the store's subject/predicate/object indexes instead of scanning every triple, so a join costs a hash lookup per solution rather than a full graph scan
- **oxirs-stream**: `DiagnosticsConfig.jaeger_endpoint` renamed to `otlp_endpoint` (env var `OTEL_EXPORTER_JAEGER_ENDPOINT` → `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`), reflecting the workspace-wide drop of the deprecated `opentelemetry-jaeger` exporter in favor of OTLP (`opentelemetry*` 0.31 → 0.32)
- Workspace-wide: `lazy_static` → `once_cell::sync::Lazy`; `num_cpus::get()` → `std::thread::available_parallelism()`; `blake3` now built with `features = ["pure"]` (no C/asm via `cc`)
- COOLJAPAN ecosystem: `oxisql-core`/`oxisql-sqlite-compat` introduced at 0.3.2 (new Pure-Rust SQLite-compatible engine; first consumer is GeoSPARQL's GeoPackage backend, see above); `oxiarc-*` compression crates 0.3.3 → 0.3.5; `oxicrypto-{core,aead,rand,mac,hash,kdf}` and `oxitls`/`oxitls-rcgen` 0.1.1 → 0.2.0; `scirs2-{core,linalg,stats,neural,graph,integrate}` 0.5.0 → 0.6.0
- Security-relevant dependency bumps: `bytes` 1.11.1 → 1.12.0 (CVE-2026-25541 fix); `kube` 3.1 → 4.0 with `k8s-openapi` 0.27 → 0.28 (`v1_31` → `v1_32` schema snapshot) for oxirs-fuseki's optional `k8s` feature
- Routine dependency bumps: tokio 1.52.3, hyper 1.10.1, tower-http 0.7, serde_json 1.0.150, async-nats 0.49, chrono 0.4.45, nalgebra 0.35, quick-xml 0.41, rstar 0.13, redis 1.3, cranelift-* 0.133.1, jsonwebtoken 10.4, aes-gcm 0.11, sha3 0.12, arrow/parquet 59, plus assorted per-crate bumps (tera, wasmi, pdf-extract, sha2, utoipa, axum-test, pbkdf2, mdns-sd, pulsar client 6.8, lapin, time, shlex, wasmparser, wasmtime, pyo3/numpy 0.29)
- Removed unused workspace dependencies: `rio_api`/`rio_turtle`/`rio_xml` (zero remaining references), `rand_distr`, `log`, `env_logger`, `urlencoding` (superseded by oxirs-core's `encoding` module), `serial_test`, `crossbeam-utils`, `tracing-opentelemetry`, `http-body-util`, `rust_decimal`, `multibase`, `k256`, `digest`, `deadpool`, `wasm-bindgen-futures`, `tracing-wasm`, `oxicrypto-sig`

### Removed — Pure-Rust Policy v2 (COOLJAPAN)
- **Breaking**: the following Cargo features were removed outright (their functionality moved to the corresponding adapter crate listed under Added — see above; building with the old feature flag now fails and the adapter crate must be added as a direct dependency):
  - `oxirs-core`'s `gpu` feature (NVML via `nvml-wrapper`)
  - `oxirs-vec`'s `cuda` and `gpu-full` features (`cuda-runtime-sys`, `cudarc`, `candle-core`); the legacy, already-unused duplicate `gpu_acceleration` module (945 lines) was also deleted in favor of `gpu`
  - `oxirs-geosparql`'s `geos-backend` feature (`geos`/`geos-sys`) — the in-tree Egenhofer/RCC8/buffer functions now return `UnsupportedOperation` directing callers to the adapter crate
  - `oxirs-tsdb`'s `duckdb` feature (`duckdb`/`libduckdb-sys`)
  - `oxirs-stream`'s `kafka` feature (`rdkafka`/`rdkafka-sys`/`libz-sys`)
  - `oxirs-stream`'s `pulsar` feature (`pulsar`/`native-tls`/`lz4-sys`)
- Net effect: every published OxiRS crate's `--all-features` dependency surface is now 100% Pure Rust; all six C-FFI integrations remain available, just as separate `publish = false` adapter crates rather than in-tree feature flags

### Fixed
- **oxirs-core**: `rdfxml::serializer` no longer collides two or more distinct unmapped namespaces on the same subject onto one hardcoded `xmlns:oxprefix` attribute; each namespace now gets its own synthetic prefix
- **oxirs-core**: `query::update`'s `INSERT DATA`/`DELETE DATA` blocks whose final triple omits the trailing `.` (legal in SPARQL's grammar, illegal in the Turtle grammar used to re-parse the block) now parse correctly
- **oxirs-core**: JSON-LD expansion no longer silently drops `@index` on indexed containers and node objects; `@protected` term-redefinition detection now also compares the `protected` flag itself; `@set` containers now expand to flat triples instead of a no-op
- **oxirs-tdb**: `DistributedTdbStore::execute_saga` previously reported success without ever calling `saga.execute()` — sagas silently never ran; they now execute for real, with results recorded to the replication log via `commit_distributed_transaction`
- **oxirs-tdb**: deadlock detector's `YoungestTransaction`/`OldestTransaction` victim selection no longer panics on an empty cycle; the distributed coordinator's `abort_transaction` now notifies all registered participants instead of a no-op
- **oxirs-chat**: AES-256-GCM key/nonce construction (`persistence_storage.rs`, `security/encryption.rs`) no longer panics on a malformed key or nonce length — returns a proper error instead
- **oxirs-chat**: `DensePassageRetriever`'s dense encoder was content-blind (embeddings were derived only from word position/count, so unrelated texts of equal length produced identical vectors); it now uses content-sensitive term-frequency plus hash-trick encoding
- **oxirs-physics**: `ResultInjector` generated invalid SPARQL — numeric/boolean values combined with an explicit `^^xsd:type` datatype annotation must be quoted strings, but were emitted as bare tokens; `execute_update()` was also a no-op that logged but never wrote to the store, so simulation results were never actually persisted — both fixed
- **oxirs-shacl**: `sh:languageIn` now does BCP47/RFC-4647 basic-filtering range matching (`"de"` matches `"de-CH"`) instead of exact string equality
- **oxirs-graphrag**: `GraphSummarizer`'s representative and relation ordering is now deterministic (lexicographically-smallest IRI, sorted-by-frequency relations) instead of depending on hash iteration order
- **oxirs-geosparql**: `compressed_storage` decompression previously collapsed polygon holes and multi-part `MultiLineString`/`MultiPolygon` geometries down to a single ring/part on round-trip; a new `ring_counts` field fixes reconstruction; `Cargo.toml`'s `cuda`/`wgpu_backend` features referenced nonexistent `scirs2-core` sub-features, breaking dependency resolution for any workspace build after the scirs2-core 0.6.0 bump — corrected
- **oxirs-wasm**: pattern and property-path matching now treats the two IRI spellings that reach the store — bracketed `<iri>` (as parsers emit) and bare `iri` (as `insert()` accepts) — as equal, so a query no longer silently misses matches depending on which form was used; property paths also gained support for the `a` (`rdf:type`) keyword

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **oxirs-fuseki**: `auth/policy_templates.rs` — `PolicyTemplateRegistry` with built-in DBA, ReadOnly, Auditor role templates; `PolicyTemplate` (serde-compatible); `apply_to_user`; `ReadAudit` permission variant; `DuplicateTemplate`/`UnknownTemplate` auth errors (18 tests)
- **oxirs-fuseki**: FIPS 140-2 `fips` feature gate for FIPS-validated cryptography via `ring`
- **oxirs-did**: FIPS 140-2 `fips` feature gate
- `docs/policies/fips-boundary.md` — RFC-003 FIPS cryptographic boundary policy
- **oxirs-graphrag**: `summarizer.rs` — `GraphSummarizer` (Leiden community detection → in-degree centrality → predicate frequency → `to_text()` natural language output) (6 tests)
- **oxirs-graphrag**: `feedback.rs` — `TripleRelevanceFeedback` / `Relevance` enum; seahash triple IDs; multiplicative weight adjustment (0.1–2.0 clamp); `apply_to_scores` sorted descending (7 tests)
- **oxirs-embed**: `models/graph_sage.rs` — `GraphSageEmbedder` inductive graph embeddings; k-hop mean aggregation with ReLU+L2-norm; Xavier init via scirs2-core; margin ranking loss; sign-SGD; LCG neighbor sampling; unseen-entity support (6 tests)
- **oxirs-shacl**: SHACL Advanced Features (SHACL-AF) — recursive shapes and qualified value shapes completed (Round 32)
- **oxirs-shacl**: SHACL-AF reasoning engine — rule-based reasoning validator with dedicated reasoning types and validation rules (Round 33)
- **oxirs-shacl-ai**: `optimization/genetic.rs` — genetic algorithm for SHACL shape constraint-order optimization (configurable population/generations/tournament/mutation via `GeneticParams`, cost-estimate fitness scoring, tournament selection)
- **oxirs-ttl**: HDT 1.0 (Header-Dictionary-Triples) binary RDF format reader — iterator-based read-only parser over Header, Dictionary, and Triples sections
- **oxirs-ttl**: streaming TriG parser — `TriGStreamingParser` pull-parser implementing `Iterator<Item = Result<StreamedQuad, _>>` for W3C TriG named graphs
- **oxirs-core**: RDF-star quoted triples in pattern matching and query execution — quoted-triple support across query algebra, executor, JIT, planner, pattern unification, and SIMD triple matching
- **oxirs**: `rset` tool now parses SPARQL Results XML (SRX) — booleans, bindings, typed/language literals, and blank nodes (via `parse_sparql_results_xml`)

### Changed
- Version bump to 0.3.1 across all workspace crates
- **Refactor** `oxirs-fuseki/src/config.rs` (1999 lines) → split into `config.rs` + `config_server.rs` + `config_security.rs` + `config_runtime.rs`; public API preserved via re-exports
- **Refactor** `oxirs-arq/src/lateral_join.rs` (1978 lines) → directory module; test block extracted to `lateral_join/lateral_join_tests.rs`; source down to 1138 lines
- **Refactor** `oxirs-federate/src/query_decomposition/advanced_pattern_analysis.rs` (1990 lines) → split into `_consciousness.rs` (252) + `_analyzer.rs` (1484) + `_quantum.rs` (298) + 16-line facade
- **Refactor** `oxirs-cluster/src/storage/persistent.rs` (1953 lines) → `persistent.rs` (710) + `persistent_wal.rs` (335) + `persistent_integrity.rs` (444) + `persistent_tests.rs` (287)
- **Refactor** `oxirs-shacl/src/targets/selector.rs` (1961 lines) → `selector.rs` (709) + `selector_query.rs` (548) + `selector_eval.rs` (641)
- **Refactor** `oxirs-shacl-ai/src/performance_monitoring.rs` (1949 lines) → `performance_monitoring.rs` (1575) + `performance_monitoring_advanced.rs` (514); fixed pre-existing Duration/field-name/Serialize bugs
- **Refactor** `oxirs-shacl-ai/src/optimization/engine.rs` (1987 lines) → `engine.rs` (1308) + `optimization/engine_analysis.rs` (718)
- 21 TODO.md files updated: 47 `[~]` items flipped to `[x]` for RFC-001 (LTS) and RFC-002 (Enterprise) now that policies are published
- Dependency: **SciRS2** workspace crates bumped 0.4.3 → 0.5.0 (all 12 `scirs2-*` sub-crates)
- Dependency: `oxiarc-*` compression crates pinned to **0.3.3** and consumed directly from crates.io — the temporary `[patch.crates-io]` path overrides were removed, leaving only `pathfinder_simd` patched (an unrelated Rust-nightly intrinsic fix)
- **Refactor (Round 31 — facade recovery)**: 13 oversized files (1602–1909 lines) across **oxirs-core**, **oxirs-vec**, **oxirs-fuseki**, **oxirs-embed**, **oxirs-shacl-ai**, **oxirs-samm**, **oxirs-rule**, and **oxirs** converted to thin facades over pre-existing sibling modules (~20K lines net removed)
- **Refactor (Round 32 — tier-2)**: **oxirs-fuseki** `auth/saml.rs` + `bind_values_enhanced.rs`, **oxirs-cluster** `cluster_metrics.rs`, **oxirs-tdb** `advanced_diagnostics.rs`, **oxirs-federate** `service.rs`, and **oxirs** `commands/jena_parity.rs` split into focused submodules
- **Refactor (Round 33 — tier-3)**: **oxirs-shacl** `constraints/expression_constraint.rs`, **oxirs-vec** `tree_indices.rs` (ball/cover/kd/rp/vp-tree), **oxirs-wasm** `query/construct.rs`, **oxirs-gql** `schema.rs`, and **oxirs-stream** `backend/kafka/backend.rs` split into submodules
- **Refactor (tools/oxirs)**: `commands/aspect.rs`, `commands/interactive.rs`, and `commands/import_command.rs` split into focused modules; `lib.rs` → `lib_commands.rs` + `lib_dispatch.rs`
- **Refactor (additional)**: **oxirs-gql** `validation_spec.rs`, **oxirs-tdb** `mvcc/mod.rs`, **oxirs-stream** `lib_types.rs` / `neuromorphic_analytics.rs` / `wasm_edge_computing.rs`, and **oxirs-core** `storage/tiered.rs` split into module directories
- **oxirs-vec**: `build.rs` CUDA-toolkit detection now emits informational build-script output instead of `cargo:warning=` (no-warnings policy); GPU acceleration remains opt-in via the `cuda` feature with Pure-Rust CPU fallbacks
- Error-handling hardening: `unwrap()` calls in the benchmark runner and performance-benchmark modules replaced with context-carrying error handling

### Changed — Pure-Rust (COOLJAPAN Policy)
- Compression: `brotli` → `oxiarc-brotli`, `snap` → `oxiarc-snappy`, `flate2` → `oxiarc-deflate` across all consuming crates (tdb, stream, federate, fuseki, cluster, arq, gql, star, embed, shacl-ai, chat, did, tools); direct `brotli`/`snap`/`flate2` deps removed
- Crypto: 27 first-party `ring::` call sites (tools/oxirs, oxirs-did, oxirs-fuseki, oxirs-cluster) migrated to **oxicrypto** leaf crates (hash/mac/aead/kdf/rand) + workspace `ed25519-dalek` + `rsa` for Ed25519/RSA signatures; all direct `ring` deps removed
- TLS: pure-Rust **`oxitls::pure_provider()`** installed process-wide at every binary entry; `rustls` no-provider, `reqwest` rustls-no-provider, `tokio-rustls` default-features=false, `metrics-exporter-prometheus` push-gateway-no-tls-provider; cluster cert-gen `rcgen` → `oxitls-rcgen`; `async-openai` gated behind non-default `openai` feature
- Fixed an `oxiarc-brotli` incompressible-input compressor bug (it emitted streams its own decoder rejected); the fix shipped upstream as **oxiarc 0.3.3** (2026-06-06) on crates.io, which OxiRS now consumes directly
- **Default `cargo build` is now free of `ring` and `aws-lc-sys`/`aws-lc-rs` C/asm crypto** — `cargo tree -i ring` and `cargo tree -i aws-lc-sys`/`aws-lc-rs` are all empty for the default feature set

### Fixed
- **oxirs-stream**: fixed undefined behavior in neuromorphic analytics — `NetworkTopology` and `NeuralResponse` removed from the unsafe `impl_zeroed_default!` macro (`std::mem::zeroed()` is UB for `Vec`/`Instant`); replaced with `derive(Default)` and a manual `Default` impl (Round 31)
- **oxirs-core**: declared `indexmap` and `toml` as workspace dependencies, fixing a latent compile break in `jsonld::{compaction,flattening}` (Round 31)
- **oxirs-vec**: restored `JointEmbeddingSpace::zero_shot_retrieval`, lost to earlier module drift (Round 31)

### Policy Compliance
- All `.rs` files under 2000 lines (proactive refactors applied)
- Zero warnings, zero errors across workspace
- Total test count: ~43,511 (+19 graphrag, +6 embed from Round 18)
