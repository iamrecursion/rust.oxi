//! RDF storage backends and implementations.
//!
//! [`MemoryStorage`] uses **term interning** and keeps *no* owned-`Quad` copies
//! at all. Each column (subject, predicate, object, graph name) is interned into
//! a `ColumnDictionary` (term <-> `u32`), and every quad lives *only* as four
//! compact `[u32; 4]` id-tuples in the SPOG/POSG/OSPG/GSPO permutation indexes.
//! All reads — `len`/`contains`/pattern queries/full scans/N-Quads export —
//! derive their `Quad` values on the fly by resolving ids back through the
//! dictionaries, so a triple costs four id-tuples plus one interned copy of each
//! *distinct* term per column, rather than a fully materialized owned `Quad`.
//!
//! ## Iteration order
//!
//! [`query_quads`](MemoryStorage::query_quads) still returns results in
//! canonical `Quad` order (it re-sorts through a `BTreeSet<Quad>` at the API
//! boundary), so its observable order is unchanged. The *streaming* scans
//! ([`iter_quads`](MemoryStorage::iter_quads) and
//! [`for_each_quad`](MemoryStorage::for_each_quad)) instead visit quads in
//! *index (term-interning) order* — the order of the leading permutation — so
//! they never materialize the whole graph at once. That order is deterministic
//! but differs from `Quad` order; RDF is unordered and the persistence /
//! serialization consumers of these scans do not depend on a particular order.
//!
//! ## Deletion and the dictionaries
//!
//! Each column dictionary reference counts its ids. A successful `insert_quad`
//! takes one reference on each of the four column ids (only *after* the SPOG
//! novelty gate, so a duplicate insert never double-counts); `remove_quad`
//! drops one reference on each. When a term's last referencing quad is removed
//! its count reaches zero and the id is reclaimed **synchronously** — the value
//! is tombstoned, its lookup entry dropped, and the id pushed onto a free list
//! for reuse by the next new term in that column. Term ids therefore never leak:
//! the dictionary's live footprint tracks the set of terms actually in use, and
//! repeated insert/remove/reinsert churn does not grow it. Round-trips stay
//! correct: a re-inserted term reuses its still-live id, and a term whose id was
//! reclaimed is re-interned into the freed slot on the next insert.
