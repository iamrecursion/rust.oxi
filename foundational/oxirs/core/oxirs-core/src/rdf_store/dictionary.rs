//! Column-oriented term dictionaries for interned quad storage.
//!
//! [`MemoryStorage`](super::MemoryStorage) stores quads as compact `[u32; 4]`
//! id-tuples instead of five full owned-`Quad` copies. Each quad column
//! (subject, predicate, object, graph name) is interned independently into a
//! [`ColumnDictionary`], mapping the strongly-typed term to a stable `u32` id
//! and back. Interning per column keeps materialization trivial and correct
//! (a stored `Object` is always a valid `Object`, `GraphName::DefaultGraph`
//! needs no special encoding).
//!
//! ## Single-owner interning
//!
//! Each distinct term is materialized **exactly once**, in a reference-counted
//! [`Arc`]. The id vector (`values`) and the reverse-lookup map (`ids`) both hold
//! *the same* `Arc<T>`, so the interned term — including its heap string bytes —
//! is stored a single time and shared by pointer, rather than being cloned into
//! both structures. This halves the per-term footprint of the dictionary (the
//! reverse map previously owned a second full copy of every key), which for the
//! high-cardinality object column is the dominant memory cost of the store.
