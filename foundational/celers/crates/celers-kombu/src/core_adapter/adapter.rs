/// # What this is for
///
/// `celers_worker::Worker` consumes from [`celers_core::Broker`]
/// (`enqueue`/`dequeue`/`ack`/`reject`/...). The transports in this workspace —
/// `celers_broker_amqp::AmqpBroker`, `celers_broker_sqs::SqsBroker` — implement
/// this crate's [`Broker`](crate::Broker)/[`Producer`](crate::Producer)/
/// [`Consumer`](crate::Consumer) traits instead, which speak
/// `publish`/`consume` over [`celers_protocol::Message`]. Without an adapter
/// those transports cannot feed a worker at all. This is that adapter.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use celers_kombu::{MockBroker, core_adapter::KombuBrokerAdapter};
/// # async fn example() {
/// // Any transport that opts into `CoreBrokerTransport`:
/// let broker = KombuBrokerAdapter::new(MockBroker::new(), "celery");
/// // ... now usable anywhere a `celers_core::Broker` is expected.
/// # let _ = broker;
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # One transport, one lock
///
/// [`celers_core::Broker`] takes `&self`; the transport traits take
/// `&mut self`. The adapter therefore owns its transport behind a
/// [`tokio::sync::Mutex`], and **every operation is serialised through it**.
///
/// That is not an implementation detail a caller can ignore. The worker's main
/// loop parks in [`dequeue`](celers_core::Broker::dequeue) holding the lock,
/// while tasks it has already dispatched call
/// [`ack`](celers_core::Broker::ack) from other tasks; those acks wait for the
/// poll to return. If the poll timeout approaches the transport's redelivery
/// window (SQS's visibility timeout, AMQP's consumer cancellation), an
/// in-flight message can be redelivered before its acknowledgement is ever
/// sent, and the task runs twice. Hence the deliberately short
/// [`DEFAULT_POLL_TIMEOUT`], and hence the guidance on
/// [`with_poll_timeout`](Self::with_poll_timeout).
///
/// Sharing one adapter between several workers compounds this: they take turns
/// on one connection rather than consuming in parallel. Give each worker its
/// own transport.
///
/// # Connecting
///
/// Neither transport connects when it is constructed, so the adapter connects
/// **lazily**: every operation checks [`Transport::is_connected`](crate::Transport::is_connected)
/// and calls [`connect`](crate::Transport::connect) first if needed. That also
/// makes it self-healing — a transport that reports itself disconnected after a
/// failure is reconnected on the next call. Call [`connect`](Self::connect)
/// explicitly if you would rather find out about a bad URL at start-up than on
/// the first message.
///
/// # At-least-once delivery
///
/// A message is never removed from the queue by dequeuing it — only by
/// [`ack`](celers_core::Broker::ack) (or by a
/// [`reject`](celers_core::Broker::reject) that does not requeue). A worker
/// that dies mid-task therefore gets the message again once the transport's
/// redelivery window expires, which is the guarantee that makes the queue
/// durable, and the reason a task must tolerate running twice.
///
/// **The adapter does not count deliveries**, and neither transport rewrites a
/// message in place, so a redelivery carries exactly the metadata the producer
/// enqueued: the same id, the same retry state. Retry *accounting* happens in
/// the worker, which acknowledges the message it ran and enqueues a fresh one
/// for the next attempt — so a task that keeps killing its worker is redelivered
/// with an unchanged budget. The backstop for that is the transport's own, and
/// it has to be configured there:
///
/// * **SQS** — a redrive policy with `maxReceiveCount`
///   ([`with_dlq`](https://docs.rs/celers-broker-sqs)), which moves a message to
///   the dead-letter queue after that many receives.
/// * **AMQP** — a dead-letter exchange, plus `x-delivery-limit` on a quorum
///   queue, which does the same for redeliveries.
///
/// # What it does not do
///
/// [`cancel`](celers_core::Broker::cancel) always reports `false`, and the
/// revocation hooks keep the trait's inert defaults: neither AMQP nor SQS can
/// address an individual message that is already queued, so there is no pending
/// copy for this adapter to find. See the method's own documentation.
