     periodically (e.g., via cron job or scheduled task) to prevent
     table bloat and maintain optimal performance.

=== Demo Complete ===
```

**Key Concepts:**
- **Idempotency Key**: A unique identifier for an operation (e.g., payment ID, request ID)
- **Task Name Scoping**: Same key can be reused across different task types
- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: How long the key remains valid (prevents permanent blocks)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Returns existing task ID if duplicate found within TTL window
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired keys are removed to prevent table bloat

     ✓ Found 2 tasks for customer 'cust-0'
       - Task xxx: process_order
       - Task yyy: process_order
  3. Querying priority customer tasks...
     ✓ Found 2 priority customer tasks

  💡 Metadata query use cases:
     - Filter tasks by customer, tenant, or organization
     - Find tasks with specific business attributes
     - Implement priority queues based on metadata
     - Track and query tasks by workflow or campaign ID

--- Demo 3: Capacity Management (Backpressure) ---

     ✓ Queue has capacity: true
  2. Enqueuing tasks with capacity check...
     ✓ Task 0 enqueued
     ✓ Task 1 enqueued
     ...
     ✗ Task 6 rejected (queue full)
     ✗ Task 7 rejected (queue full)

     ✓ Successfully enqueued 5 tasks (max capacity: 5)
     ✓ Current queue size: 5
  3. Processing 3 tasks to free capacity...
     ✓ Queue now has capacity: true

--- Demo 4: Task Expiration (TTL) ---

     ✓ Created 5 tasks
     ✓ Pending tasks: 5
  2. Waiting 2 seconds for tasks to age...
  3. Expiring tasks older than 1 second...
     ✓ Expired 5 stale tasks
     ✓ Pending tasks now: 0
     ✓ Cancelled tasks: 5

  💡 Tip: Run expire_pending_tasks() periodically to clean up
     abandoned tasks (e.g., from crashed clients or cancelled operations)

--- Demo 5: Batch State Updates ---
  1. Creating 10 test tasks...
     ✓ Created 10 tasks
  2. Updating 5 tasks to 'processing' state in batch...
     ✓ Updated 5 tasks to processing

  Queue State Distribution:
    - Pending: 5

## Task Types

Both examples use these task types:

### EmailTask
```rust
struct EmailTask {
    to: String,
    subject: String,
    body: String,
}
```

Used for `send_email` tasks.

### ProcessingTask
```rust
struct ProcessingTask {
    id: u64,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}
```

Used for `process_data` tasks.

## Customizing Examples

### Adding New Task Types

1. Define your task structure:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct MyCustomTask {
    field1: String,
    field2: i32,
}
```

2. Create a processor:
```rust
struct MyTaskProcessor;

#[async_trait::async_trait]
impl TaskProcessor for MyTaskProcessor {
    async fn process(&self, task_name: &str, payload: &[u8]) -> Result<(), String> {
        if task_name == "my_custom_task" {
            let task: MyCustomTask = serde_json::from_slice(payload)?;
            // Process task...
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err(format!("Unknown task: {}", task_name))
        }
    }
}
```

3. Add to CompositeProcessor in worker_pool.rs:
```rust
Self {
    processors: vec![
        Box::new(EmailProcessor),
        Box::new(DataProcessor),
        Box::new(MyTaskProcessor),  // Add your processor
    ],
}
```

### Adjusting Worker Pool Settings

In `worker_pool.rs`, modify `WorkerConfig`:

```rust
let worker_config = WorkerConfig {
    worker_id: format!("worker-{}", uuid::Uuid::new_v4()),
    max_concurrent_tasks: 20,           // Increase for more parallelism
    poll_interval: Duration::from_millis(50),  // Poll more frequently
    retry_delay: Duration::from_secs(10),      // Wait longer on errors
};
```

### Connection Pool Tuning

In both examples, adjust `PoolConfig`:

```rust
let pool_config = PoolConfig {
    max_connections: 50,        // More connections for high throughput
    min_connections: 10,        // Keep more idle connections
    acquire_timeout_secs: 30,
    max_lifetime_secs: Some(3600),  // Recycle connections hourly
    idle_timeout_secs: Some(600),
};
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Check Queue Status

```bash
mysql -u root -p celers_dev -e "
SELECT
    state,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM celers_tasks
GROUP BY state;
"
```

### View Processing Tasks

```bash
mysql -u root -p celers_dev -e "
SELECT
    id,
    task_name,
    worker_id,
    started_at,
    retry_count
FROM celers_tasks
WHERE state = 'processing'
ORDER BY started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Check Dead Letter Queue

```bash
mysql -u root -p celers_dev -e "
SELECT
    task_id,
    task_name,
    error_message,
    failed_at
FROM celers_dead_letter_queue
ORDER BY failed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
"
```

### Enable MySQL Query Log

For debugging slow queries:
```sql
SET GLOBAL general_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL log_output = 'TABLE';

-- View queries
SELECT * FROM mysql.general_log ORDER BY event_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create broker"

- Check MySQL is running: `mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT 1"`
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- Check user permissions: `GRANT ALL ON celers_dev.* TO 'root'@'localhost'`

### "No tasks available"

- Run task_producer first to enqueue tasks
- Check pending count: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM celers_tasks WHERE state = 'pending'`
- Verify worker is running and not paused

### "Task processing is slow"

- Increase `max_concurrent_tasks` in WorkerConfig
- Increase `max_connections` in PoolConfig
- Check MySQL query performance with EXPLAIN
- Verify indexes are in place: `SHOW INDEX FROM celers_tasks`

### "Too many connections"

- Reduce `max_connections` in PoolConfig
- Increase MySQL `max_connections`: `SET GLOBAL max_connections = 500;`
- Check for connection leaks

- **Load Testing**: Generate realistic load for benchmarking
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify and fix slow queries
- **Disaster Recovery**: Replay failed tasks after bug fixes
- **Health Monitoring**: Proactive detection of issues
- **Capacity Planning**: Test infrastructure under load

## Best Practices

1. **Use Connection Pooling**: Configure pool size based on workload
2. **Set Appropriate Timeouts**: Balance between responsiveness and patience
3. **Monitor Health**: Implement health checks and alerting
4. **Handle Failures Gracefully**: Use retry logic and dead letter queues
5. **Log Everything**: Use structured logging for debugging
6. **Test Under Load**: Benchmark with production-like data
7. **Clean Up Regularly**: Archive old tasks and optimize tables
8. **Use Transactions**: Ensure data consistency

## Performance Tips

1. **Batch Operations**: Use `enqueue_batch()` for multiple tasks
2. **Optimize Indexes**: Ensure proper indexes on queue_name, state, priority
3. **Tune Buffer Pool**: Set `innodb_buffer_pool_size` to 70-80% of RAM
4. **Use SSDs**: Much faster than HDDs for database operations
5. **Reduce Polling**: Increase `poll_interval` if queue is usually empty
6. **Connection Reuse**: Keep connections alive with proper pool settings
