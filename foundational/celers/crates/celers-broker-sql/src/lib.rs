//! MySQL broker implementation for CeleRS
//!
//! This broker uses MySQL with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for reliable,
//! distributed task queue processing.
//!
//! # Minimum server version
//!
//! `FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED` — which every dequeue path depends on — was
//! introduced in **MySQL 8.0.1** and **MariaDB 10.6**. It does not exist in
//! MySQL 5.7 or in any earlier MariaDB release, where every dequeue would
//! fail with a parse error.
//!
//! The version is probed once at connect time
//! ([`MysqlBroker::new`] / [`MysqlBroker::with_queue`] /
//! [`MysqlBroker::with_config`] / [`MysqlBroker::with_circuit_breaker_config`])
//! and an unsupported server is rejected with a
//! [`celers_core::CelersError::Configuration`] naming the required version.
//! A version string the probe cannot parse (proxies, forks) is logged and
//! accepted — see [`server_version`].
//!
//! It supports:
//! - Priority queues
//! - Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for permanently failed tasks
//! - Delayed task execution (enqueue_at, enqueue_after)
//! - Prometheus metrics (optional `metrics` feature)
//! - Batch enqueue/dequeue/ack operations
//! - Transaction safety
//! - Distributed workers without contention
//! - Queue pause/resume functionality
//! - DLQ inspection and requeue
//! - Task status inspection
//! - Database health checks
//! - Automatic task archiving
//!
//! # Retention
//!
//! `ack` keeps terminal (`completed`/`cancelled`/`failed`) rows in
//! `celers_tasks` for auditing. Since `celers_tasks` is also the table every
//! `dequeue` scans, prune it with [`MysqlBroker::purge_terminal_tasks`] for a
//! one-shot chunked sweep, or start a background sweeper with
//! [`MysqlBroker::spawn_retention_task`].
