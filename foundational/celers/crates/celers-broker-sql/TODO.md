## MySQL-Specific Implementation Details

### Data Type Mappings
- UUID -> `CHAR(36)` (text representation)
- BYTEA -> `MEDIUMBLOB` (binary large object)
- TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE -> `TIMESTAMP` (MySQL doesn't have timezone-aware timestamps)
- JSONB -> `JSON` (MySQL native JSON type)

### Query Differences from PostgreSQL
- PostgreSQL `$1, $2` placeholders -> MySQL `?, ?` placeholders
- PostgreSQL `ANY($1)` array parameter -> MySQL `IN (?, ?, ...)` dynamic placeholders
- PostgreSQL `gen_random_uuid()` -> MySQL `UUID()` function
- PostgreSQL `NOW() + INTERVAL '5 seconds'` -> MySQL `DATE_ADD(NOW(), INTERVAL 5 SECOND)`
- PostgreSQL `FILTER (WHERE ...)` -> MySQL `SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`
- PostgreSQL `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` -> MySQL `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`

### Stored Procedures
- Uses MySQL stored procedure syntax instead of PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL
- `DELIMITER //` and `DELIMITER ;` for procedure definition
- `CALL move_to_dlq(?)` to invoke

## Hardening pass (0.3.1) — what changed

Superseding parts of the two audit sections below:

- **`queue_name` is now a real column.** Migration `009_queue_name.sql` adds an
  indexed `celers_tasks.queue_name`, backfilled from the JSON `$.queue` label.
  Every enqueue path binds it; `dequeue`, `dequeue_batch`,
  `dequeue_with_worker_id`, `queue_size` and `get_statistics` filter on it.
  Section 1 below ("used only as a logical JSON label") is therefore
  **obsolete** — the label is still written for compatibility, but the column
  is authoritative.
- **The broker's result table now has a migration** — and a new name.
  `010_broker_results.sql` creates `celers_broker_results`; the table was
  called `celers_task_results` until that name was ceded to
  `celers-backend-db`'s result backend, which auto-migrates an incompatible
  table of the same name into the same database (Known gaps #16, now closed).
  Existing databases are carried across by `migrate()`'s untracked
  `rename_legacy_broker_results_table` step. Section 2's missing-table census
  is reduced by one.
- **The migration runner was broken and is fixed.** `run_migration` skipped
  any `;`-chunk starting with `--`, which discarded the first statement of
  every migration file — including `CREATE TABLE celers_migrations` — so
  `migrate()` failed on every fresh database. Comments are now stripped
  line-wise before the `;` split, and the stored-procedure body's trailing
  `//` delimiter marker is removed before submission.
- **`broker_core.rs` is under the 2000-line limit** (`broker_dequeue.rs` and
  `broker_results.rs` split out). The "broker_core.rs size" section below is
  resolved.

### Still open (queue scoping)

Deliberately **not** queue-scoped, documented rather than silently narrowed:
`purge_all`, `purge_by_state`, `purge_by_task_name`, `archive_completed_tasks`,
`recover_stuck_tasks`, `list_tasks`, `count_by_task_name`,
`query_tasks_by_metadata`, and every DLQ helper (the DLQ table has no
`queue_name` column of its own). Adding a `queue_name` column to
`celers_dead_letter_queue` and a scoped variant of each destructive helper is
a follow-up.

Also still open: `celers_queue_config`, `celers_worker_heartbeat`,
`celers_task_groups` and `celers_task_idempotency` remain without migrations.

## queue_name schema drift audit (2026-07)

This section is a documentation-only note, mirroring the equivalent audit performed this
round in `celers-broker-postgres`'s `TODO.md` (`## queue_name schema drift (2026-07)`).
It has been rewritten in full this pass to correct and consolidate two earlier partial
write-ups into one authoritative table-by-table census, after a deeper follow-up audit
found 2 more missing-table cases beyond the 3 originally documented here.

### 1. Spine + queue_name model: CONFIRMED CLEAN

`MysqlBroker::queue_name` (see the field doc comment in `src/broker_core.rs`) is used
consistently, everywhere in this crate, only as a logical JSON label — stored as
`"queue": self.queue_name` inside the `celers_tasks.metadata` JSON blob at enqueue time.
It is never a real column and never spliced into a table name. Confirmed by direct read
of `src/broker_trait.rs`'s `enqueue()`:

```rust
let mut db_metadata = json!({
    "queue": self.queue_name,
    "enqueued_at": chrono::Utc::now().to_rfc3339(),
});
```

This round, the core `Broker` trait implementation (`src/broker_trait.rs`) and the
migration runner plus batch-impl helpers in `src/broker_core.rs` were read in full and
confirmed clean. **Zero column-drift bugs and zero table-interpolation bugs were found
anywhere in this crate** — unlike the Postgres broker, which exhibits both the
queue_name-as-nonexistent-column and queue_name-as-table-name drift patterns. `queue_name`
is not the real problem in this crate; see below.

### 2. The real issue: 5 tables referenced by code that no migration ever creates

A full grep of `CREATE TABLE` across every file in `migrations/` shows the tables that
actually exist are: `celers_migrations` (000), `celers_tasks` / `celers_dead_letter_queue`
/ `celers_task_history` (001), `celers_results` (002), `celers_idempotency_keys` (006),
`celers_workflows` / `celers_workflow_nodes` / `celers_workflow_edges` (007), and
`celers_rate_limits` / `celers_locks` / `celers_task_tags` / `celers_metrics` (008).
`migrations/004_partitioning_guide.sql` and `migrations/005_uuid_optimization.sql`
contain only SQL comments (documentation), and are never passed to
`run_migration_tracked` — they create nothing.

Against that real set, 5 tables are referenced by production code but created by no
migration anywhere. Two of these (`celers_task_results`, `celers_task_idempotency`) were
not previously documented here and are worse than the 3 already known, because they break
whole features (result storage piggybacked with recurring-task config, and idempotent
enqueue) rather than being isolated to drain-mode/heartbeat/group bookkeeping.

#### `celers_task_results` — DEFERRED

Referenced by:
- `src/broker_core.rs`: `store_result` (line 693), `get_result` (line 741),
  `delete_result` (line 778), `archive_results` (line 791), `optimize_tables`
  (line 849), `analyze_tables` (line 877).
- `src/broker_batch.rs`: `store_result_batch` (line 132), `get_result_batch` (line 213).
- `src/broker_resilience.rs`: the recurring-task family piggybacks its config storage
  on this same nonexistent table via a naming convention — `register_recurring_task`
  (line 226), `process_recurring_tasks` (line 276, referenced twice in this one function),
  `list_recurring_tasks` (line 356), `delete_recurring_task` (line 389).
- `src/broker_diagnostics.rs`: `ack_batch_with_results` (line 340, marked
  `#[allow(dead_code)]`).
- `src/broker_advanced.rs`: `vacuum_analyze` (line 296), via its hardcoded `tables` vec.

The real migrated table is `celers_results` (from `002_results.sql`), but its column set
is incompatible with what this code expects (`id CHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY, task_id CHAR(36)
NOT NULL, task_name, result MEDIUMBLOB, error_message, state, created_at, completed_at,
expires_at` vs. the code's assumed columns keyed directly by `task_id`). This is not a
simple rename fix — it needs a genuine schema decision (new migration vs. rewriting the
code against `celers_results`'s real columns), and the recurring-task feature is
conceptually a different concern squatting on a results table by naming convention alone.
**Status: DEFERRED, needs a live DB to verify any fix safely.**

#### `celers_task_idempotency` — DEFERRED

Referenced by `src/broker_resilience.rs`: `enqueue_with_idempotency` (line 901,
referenced twice), `get_idempotency_record` (line 1030), `cleanup_expired_idempotency_keys`
(line 1095), `get_idempotency_statistics` (line 1139).

The real migrated table is `celers_idempotency_keys` (from `006_idempotency.sql`), which
has `idempotency_key VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY` as its natural key. The code's model,
however, treats a separate `id` UUID as the identity and can insert multiple rows per
`(idempotency_key, task_id)` pair over time (e.g. after TTL expiry) — which the real
table's PK would reject outright. This needs an actual primary-key-model decision (not
just adding columns), is potentially destructive to migrate (MySQL has no `ADD COLUMN IF
NOT EXISTS`-style safety net for PK changes), and cannot be verified without a live DB.
**Status: DEFERRED.**

#### `celers_queue_config`, `celers_worker_heartbeat`, `celers_task_groups` — DEFERRED (unchanged)

These 3 were already documented in an earlier pass of this section; line numbers
re-verified fresh this round and folded into this single authoritative census instead of
being split across old/new sections.

```
$ grep -n "celers_queue_config\|celers_worker_heartbeat\|celers_task_groups" crates/celers-broker-sql/src/broker_batch.rs
309:            INSERT INTO celers_queue_config (queue_name, config_key, config_value, updated_at)
326:            INSERT INTO celers_queue_config (queue_name, config_key, config_value, updated_at)
344:            FROM celers_queue_config
392:            INSERT INTO celers_worker_heartbeat
423:            UPDATE celers_worker_heartbeat
484:            FROM celers_worker_heartbeat
603:            INSERT INTO celers_task_groups
```

- `celers_queue_config` (lines 309, 326, 344) — used by `enable_drain_mode` (line 306), `disable_drain_mode` (line 323), and `is_drain_mode` (line 340) to persist/read a per-queue `drain_mode` flag.
- `celers_worker_heartbeat` (lines 392, 423, 484) — used by `register_worker` (line 379), `update_worker_heartbeat` (line 416), and `get_all_worker_heartbeats` (line 469) for worker liveness tracking.
- `celers_task_groups` (line 603) — used by `enqueue_group` (line 552) to record group_id/queue_name/task_count/metadata for a batch-enqueued task group. Notably, the sibling read function `get_group_status` (line 645) does **not** query `celers_task_groups` at all — it derives group status directly from `celers_tasks` via `JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(metadata, '$.group_id')) = ?`, which is the correct/working pattern. This makes the `celers_task_groups` INSERT in `enqueue_group` effectively write-only within this crate today (nothing in `src/broker_batch.rs` reads it back).

Fix direction (not implemented here): either add migrations creating
`celers_queue_config`, `celers_worker_heartbeat`, and `celers_task_groups` with the
columns these queries expect, or rework the three call sites to use an existing
table/column (e.g. folding drain-mode and task-group bookkeeping into `celers_tasks.metadata`,
the way `get_group_status` already does).

**None of these 5 missing-table problems are fixed by this round of changes** — all 5
need either a live database to verify a schema/PK redesign safely, or a deliberate
decision about which of two incompatible code paths to keep. They remain deferred.

### 3. Fixed this round

Two categories of safe, no-live-DB-needed fixes were made this pass:

- **Raw SQL string interpolation cleaned up** in `src/broker_resilience.rs`:
  `export_tasks()` and `export_dlq()` previously built query text with
  `format!("... '{}'", value)` / `format!(" LIMIT {}", value)` spliced in via
  `String::push_str`, instead of using bound parameters. This was a low-actual-risk
  anti-pattern (the interpolated `state` value comes from a closed Rust enum's
  `Display` impl, and `limit` is a plain integer — no untrusted string ever reached
  these call sites), but it is now fixed to use `?` placeholders with conditional
  `.bind(...)` calls, matching the safe pattern already used elsewhere in this crate
  (e.g. `src/broker_enhanced.rs`'s `count_by_state_quick()` and
  `update_batch_state()`). At the time of this fix, `sqlx::AssertSqlSafe(query)` was the
  mechanism relied on for this guarantee; `sqlx` has since been fully removed from this
  crate in favor of `oxisql-mysql` (see CHANGELOG 0.3.0's Pure-Rust Migration), but the
  same safety property — static query text plus only `?`-bound placeholders, no raw
  string interpolation — still holds today.

- **`verify_migrations()` hardcoded lists corrected** in `src/broker_diagnostics.rs`.
  Previously all 3 of its hardcoded lists were wrong in ways that made it report a
  perfectly healthy, fully-migrated database as broken:
  - The "migrations table doesn't exist yet" branch listed 8 filenames including the
    2 comment-only files (`004_partitioning_guide.sql`, `005_uuid_optimization.sql`);
    it now lists only the 6 real tracked migration filenames, with `missing_count`
    corrected from `8` to `6` to match.
  - The `expected` array held filenames (`"001_init.sql"`, ...) but was compared
    against `SELECT version FROM celers_migrations`, which holds plain version codes
    (`"001"`, ...) — a mismatch that made every migration always show as "missing"
    even when fully applied. It was also missing `"007"` entirely. `expected` is now
    `["001", "002", "003", "006", "007", "008"]`, matching what `migrate()` actually
    records.
  - The `core_tables` check listed 5 of the tables documented as missing in section 2
    above (`celers_task_results`, `celers_task_idempotency`, `celers_queue_config`,
    `celers_worker_heartbeat`, `celers_task_groups`), which could never pass. It now
    checks `["celers_tasks", "celers_dead_letter_queue", "celers_task_history",
    "celers_results", "celers_idempotency_keys"]` — tables that are both real and
    load-bearing. The 5 genuinely-missing tables are deliberately **not** added back;
    this diagnostic should not paper over the deferred problem in section 2.

  After this fix, `verify_migrations()` on a freshly-migrated database correctly
  reports `schema_valid: true` with an empty `missing_migrations` list and a complete
  `applied_migrations` list.

### 4. Dead-feature gap (lower priority, noted but not investigated further)

`migrations/007_workflow.sql` creates `celers_workflows`, `celers_workflow_nodes`, and
`celers_workflow_edges`, but a grep confirms no code in this crate ever reads or writes
them — `src/workflow.rs` only defines in-memory types (`Workflow`, `WorkflowStage`,
`WorkflowBuilder`, hook infrastructure, etc.) with zero `sqlx::query` calls. This is a
separate, lower-priority gap from the 5 missing-table problem above (here the migration
exists but the feature doesn't use it, rather than the reverse) and has not been
investigated further this round.

### 5. Stale-schema-description corrections

Earlier revisions of this file described `celers_queue_config`, `celers_worker_heartbeat`,
and `celers_task_groups` (see the "Queue Config Table" / "Worker Heartbeat Table" / "Task
Groups Table" entries under **Schema Design** below, and the corresponding "Production
Features Migration" bullet under **Recent Enhancements**) as if they were part of an
already-migrated, working schema. They are not — per section 2 above, no migration
creates any of them. The real `008_production_features.sql` instead creates
`celers_rate_limits`, `celers_locks`, `celers_task_tags`, and `celers_metrics`. The
Schema Design / Recent Enhancements sections below have not been rewritten line-by-line
in this pass (that duplication is left as future cleanup), but this note supersedes them
as the accurate statement of what `008_production_features.sql` actually contains.

## broker_core.rs size (2026-07)

`src/broker_core.rs` was 2051 lines, over this project's 2000-line
refactor-policy threshold.

**Status: RESOLVED (0.3.1).** Split along the file's own section markers:

- `src/broker_dequeue.rs` — `dequeue_with_worker_id`, `enqueue_batch_impl`,
  `dequeue_batch_impl`, plus the shared `claim_pending_rows` /
  `mark_rows_processing` helpers the single-task path also uses.
- `src/broker_results.rs` — the `// ========== Task Result Storage ==========`
  section (`store_result`, `get_result`, `delete_result`, `archive_results`).

Splitting along that seam also collapsed the three duplicated dequeue bodies
into one shared claim helper and one shared row mapper
(`src/sql_text.rs`, `src/task_row.rs`), which is what stopped the same bug
from living in three places at once.
