## Recently Completed Enhancements

### v0.3.0 Release Hardening ✅ (Latest - 2026-07-12)

      Sun-Thu instead of Mon-Fri and `"0"` (Sunday) was rejected as out of range
- [x] Webhook alert delivery migrated from `reqwest` to `oxihttp-client` (Pure Rust policy)

## Known Issues

- Leader election (`heartbeat.rs`'s `BeatHeartbeat`) is lease/heartbeat-based over a pluggable
  `DistributedLockBackend` (`InMemoryLockBackend` in this crate; Redis/PostgreSQL-backed via
  `celers-backend-redis`/`celers-backend-db`), not a full consensus protocol — no Raft/etcd-style
  election is implemented (see "Multiple schedulers with leader election" below)
- Solar calculations use deprecated API (accepted with #[allow(deprecated)])

## Dependencies

- `chrono` - Date/time handling
- `chrono-tz` - Timezone support
- `serde` - Serialization
- `thiserror` - Error types

### Optional Dependencies
- `cron` - Cron expression parsing (feature: "cron")
- `sunrise` - Solar event calculation (feature: "solar")

## Notes

- Multi-instance deployments should wire up `BeatScheduler::with_heartbeat`
  (`heartbeat::BeatHeartbeat`) over a shared `DistributedLockBackend` for lease-based leader
  election + automatic failover; without it, run only one scheduler instance
- Interval, Crontab, and Solar schedules are all production-ready
- Compatible with Python Celery Beat schedule format
