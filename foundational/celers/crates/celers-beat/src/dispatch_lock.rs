//! Per-fire dispatch locking (duplicate-execution prevention)
//!
//! When several beat instances run against the same schedule store — for
//! redundancy or during a rolling deploy — they will all independently decide
//! that the same entry is due at the same instant. Without coordination each
//! instance would dispatch the task, producing duplicate fires.
//!
//! This module closes that gap by acquiring a short-lived distributed lock
//! *before* an entry is dispatched and releasing it afterwards. The lock key is
//! derived from the entry name together with the precise scheduled fire instant
//! (see [`dispatch_lock_key`]), so the mutual exclusion is scoped to a single
//! fire: exactly one instance wins the race for a given `(entry, instant)` and
//! the losers skip that fire. Once the winner releases the lock and marks the
//! entry as run, its *next* fire is a different instant — hence a different key —
//! and is free to be acquired again.
//!
//! The lock operations are delegated to the configured
//! [`celers_core::lock::DistributedLockBackend`] when one is set (Redis, a
//! database, or [`crate::lock::InMemoryLockBackend`] for tests/single-process),
//! and fall back to the in-process [`crate::lock::LockManager`] otherwise. This
//! mirrors the backend-selection logic already used by Phase 9 leader election.
