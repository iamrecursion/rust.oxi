# celers-canvas TODO

> Canvas workflow primitives for distributed task orchestration

**Version: 0.3.1 | Status: [Stable] | Updated: 2026-08-26 | Tests: 473 (388 unit/integration + 85 doc)**

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Production-Ready with Full Feature Set

All Canvas workflow primitives implemented and production-ready.
Major enhancements added: cancellation, retry policies, timeouts, loops, state tracking, DAG export, error propagation control, sub-workflow isolation, workflow recovery/checkpointing, workflow compilation/optimization framework, comprehensive visualization support, and production-ready enhancements (metrics collection, rate limiting, concurrency control, workflow registry).

**Latest enhancements (v0.3.0):**
- Real nested chain/group execution for chords: a chord nested inside a chain/group now has its
  header fanned out and its callback enqueued (via a shared `apply_chord_element` helper), instead
  of the callback being silently dropped
- Workflow DAG visualization export (`DagVisualize::to_mermaid()`/`to_dot()`) for `CanvasElement`,
  `NestedChain`, `NestedGroup`, and the advanced primitives (`Map`, `Starmap`, `Chunks`, `Branch`,
  `Switch`), with deterministic node ids and labelled fan-out/fan-in/chord/decision edges
- Workflow loops/iteration (`WorkflowLoop`, `WorkflowMap`), sub-workflow composition
  (`SubWorkflow`, `WorkflowComposition`), and parameterized templates (`ParamTemplate`) with real
  `${name}` placeholder substitution
- Workflow versioning + migration (`to_versioned_json`/`from_versioned_json`, `MigrationRegistry`)
  for upgrading older serialized payloads on load
- Rate-limit-aware dispatch: `Group::with_rate_limit`/`rate_limited_countdowns` derive
  per-member staggered dispatch countdowns from a token-bucket `RateLimitConfig`
- All 318 unit/integration tests (`cargo nextest --all-features`, 2 further `ignore`d) + 78 doc
  tests (3 further `ignore`d) passing (396 total)

**Latest enhancements (v0.2.0):**
- Added comprehensive utility methods for workflow introspection and manipulation
- Enhanced Chain, Group, and Signature with 20+ new convenience methods
- Improved code quality with zero clippy warnings
- All 194 unit tests + 66 doc tests passing (196 total)

## Known Limitations

- Chord requires Redis backend (atomic INCR for barrier synchronization)
- Frontend visualization UI not included (by design - use provided data export formats: WorkflowVisualizationData, ExecutionTimeline, DagExport)

## Dependencies

- `celers-core` - Task types
- `celers-backend-redis` - Chord state management (optional)
- `uuid` - Workflow IDs
- `serde` - Serialization

## Notes

- Chord implementation uses Redis atomic INCR for thread-safe counter
- All workflows are Celery-compatible
- Workflow IDs are UUIDs for global uniqueness
