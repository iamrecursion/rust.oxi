//! Shared dispatch machinery for the canvas primitives.
//!
//! Every canvas primitive ([`Chain`](crate::Chain), [`Group`](crate::Group),
//! [`Chord`](crate::Chord), [`Map`](crate::Map), …) ultimately has to turn a
//! [`Signature`] into a [`SerializedTask`] and hand it to a
//! [`Broker`]. Doing that in each primitive independently is how
//! `options.countdown`, `options.link` and friends came to be silently dropped
//! on the floor, so all of them funnel through this module instead.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! The payload of a canvas-dispatched task is a JSON object:
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "args":    [ ... ],
//!   "kwargs":  { ... },
//!   "chain":   [ <ChainStep>, <ChainStep>, ... ],
//!   "errback": [ <ChainStep>, <ChainStep>, ... ],
//!   "ignore_errors": true,
//!   "retry_policy": {"delay": 2, "backoff": 2.0, "max_delay": 3600}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `args`/`kwargs` are the task's own arguments. `chain` is present only when
//! the task is a non-final step of a chain and carries the **entire remaining
//! tail** as serialized [`ChainStep`]s. The last three keys are the failure
//! half of the same contract — the task's error route, its failure-suppression
//! flag and its own retry backoff — and are present only when declared; see
//! [`ERROR_ROUTE_KEY`], [`IGNORE_ERRORS_KEY`] and [`RETRY_POLICY_KEY`].
//!
//! Carrying the whole tail is deliberate:
//! [`TaskMetadata::on_success_link`](celers_core::TaskMetadata::on_success_link)
//! is only an `Option<String>` — a task *name* — so it cannot express the
//! successor's args, kwargs, priority, countdown or its own successor. The name
//! is still written into `on_success_link` for plain task steps (so monitoring
//! and Celery-style tooling see the link), while the tail in the payload carries
//! everything the name cannot.
//!
//! The worker pops the head of `chain` on successful completion, applies the
//! predecessor's result to it according to its
//! [`CallbackArgMode`](crate::CallbackArgMode), and re-dispatches it with the
//! remainder of the tail still attached — so an N-task chain runs all N steps.
//! A [`ChainStep::Branch`]/[`ChainStep::Switch`] step is *evaluated* against
//! that result instead, and the selected arm becomes the next task.
