//! Event snapshots and event-based alerting.
//!
//! This module builds on the real-time event types in [`crate::event`] to
//! provide two cooperating pieces:
//!
//! 1. **Snapshots** ([`EventSnapshot`], [`EventSnapshotBuilder`]) — a periodic
//!    aggregate of cluster state: counts of tasks by lifecycle state, queue
//!    depth, worker count and a timestamp. Snapshots are cheap to produce, easy
//!    to serialize, and are themselves a useful input to alerting.
//!
//! 2. **A rule engine** ([`AlertRule`], [`AlertRuleKind`], [`AlertEvaluator`])
//!    that consumes a stream of [`Event`]s and/or [`EventSnapshot`]s and emits
//!    [`RuleAlert`]s when a rule trips. Rules support *hysteresis* (separate
//!    trip / clear thresholds) and a *cooldown* so a flapping condition does not
//!    produce a storm of alerts. The engine also emits a recovery alert when a
//!    previously-firing rule clears.
//!
//! It deliberately reuses the existing [`crate::event::AlertSeverity`] type
//! rather than introducing a parallel severity enum.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use celers_core::alerting::{AlertEvaluator, AlertRule, EventSnapshotBuilder};
//! use celers_core::event::{AlertSeverity, Event, TaskEventBuilder};
//! use uuid::Uuid;
//!
//! // Fail if more than 50% of tasks fail over the recent window, recover under 20%.
//! let rule = AlertRule::failure_rate("high-failures", AlertSeverity::Error, 0.5)
//!     .with_clear_threshold(0.2)
//!     .with_min_samples(4);
//!
//! let mut eval = AlertEvaluator::new().with_rule(rule);
//!
//! // Feed some failing task events; once the window has enough samples and the
//! // failure rate crosses 0.5, an alert is produced.
//! let mut last = Vec::new();
//! for _ in 0..4 {
//!     let ev = TaskEventBuilder::new(Uuid::new_v4(), "t").hostname("w1").failed("Boom");
//!     last = eval.observe_event(&ev);
//! }
//! assert!(last.iter().any(|a| a.rule_name == "high-failures"));
//! ```
