//! Distributed lock backend trait for beat scheduler
//!
//! Provides the `DistributedLockBackend` trait that enables distributed lock
//! management across multiple beat scheduler instances. Implementations can
//! use Redis, databases, or in-memory stores as the backing mechanism.

use async_trait::async_trait;

/// Backend for distributed lock management.
///
/// Used by the beat scheduler to prevent duplicate task execution across
/// multiple scheduler instances. Each implementation provides atomic
/// lock operations with TTL-based expiration.
///
/// # Lock Semantics
///
/// - Locks are identified by a string key (typically the task name)
/// - Each lock has an owner (typically the scheduler instance ID)
/// - Locks expire after a configurable TTL to prevent deadlocks
/// - Only the owner can release or renew a lock
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use celers_core::lock::DistributedLockBackend;
///
/// // `dyn`-safe on purpose: a scheduler holds whichever backend it was
/// // configured with, without being generic over it.
/// async fn schedule_task(backend: &dyn DistributedLockBackend) -> celers_core::Result<()> {
///     if backend.try_acquire("my_task", "scheduler-1", 300).await? {
///         // Execute the task
///         // ...
///         backend.release("my_task", "scheduler-1").await?;
///     }
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
