//! In-memory broker and result backend for local development and testing.
//!
//! This module provides fully-featured, dependency-free, in-process
//! implementations of the [`Broker`](crate::Broker) and
//! [`ResultStore`] traits. They are intended for local
//! development, unit/integration tests, and example code where standing up an
//! external service such as Redis is undesirable.
//!
//! Both types are backed by [`tokio`]-synchronised data structures so they can
//! be shared freely across tasks via [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc) and exercised from
//! concurrent code exactly like a real broker/backend.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## In-memory broker round-trip
//!
//! ```
//! use celers_core::{Broker, InMemoryBroker, SerializedTask};
//!
//! # async fn example() -> celers_core::Result<()> {
//! let broker = InMemoryBroker::new();
//!
//! let task = SerializedTask::new("send_email".to_string(), vec![1, 2, 3]);
//! let id = broker.enqueue(task).await?;
//!
//! let msg = broker.dequeue().await?.expect("a message is available");
//! assert_eq!(msg.task_id(), id);
//!
//! // Acknowledge with the receipt handle the broker attached on dequeue.
//! broker.ack(&id, msg.receipt_handle.as_deref()).await?;
//! assert_eq!(broker.queue_size().await?, 0);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! # tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread()
//! #     .enable_all()
//! #     .build()
//! #     .unwrap()
//! #     .block_on(example())
//! #     .unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## In-memory result backend
//!
//! ```
//! use celers_core::{InMemoryResultBackend, ResultStore, TaskResultValue};
//! use uuid::Uuid;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> celers_core::Result<()> {
//! let backend = InMemoryResultBackend::new();
//! let id = Uuid::new_v4();
//!
//! backend
//!     .store_result(id, TaskResultValue::Success(serde_json::json!(42)))
//!     .await?;
//! assert!(backend.has_result(id).await?);
