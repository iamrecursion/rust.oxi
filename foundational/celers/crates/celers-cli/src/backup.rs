//! Backup and restore functionality for CeleRS broker state.
//!
//! Provides complete backup and restore capabilities for broker state including
//! queues, scheduled tasks, worker configurations, and metrics.
//!
//! Full snapshots are captured via [`create_backup_incremental`] (called with no baseline)
//! and restored via [`restore_backup_with_policy`]. This module additionally supports:
//!
//! - **Incremental backups** ([`create_backup_incremental`]): capture only the
//!   queue/task/schedule entries that are new or changed relative to a prior backup
//!   archive (or, best-effort, relative to an explicit `--since` timestamp).
//! - **Conflict resolution on restore** ([`restore_backup_with_policy`] /
//!   [`ConflictPolicy`]): control what happens when a queue being restored already has
//!   live content at the target broker (skip it, overwrite it, or merge the two).

///    different, in the previous archive is retained). This is the recommended,
///    deterministic mode, since it does not depend on wall-clock timestamps embedded in
///    task payloads.
/// 2. `since`, if given and `previous_backup_path` is `None`: an RFC 3339 timestamp,
///    applied via [`filter_backup_since`]. Task entries are kept only if their embedded
///    `metadata.updated_at` (falling back to `metadata.created_at`) is at or after
///    `since`; entries without a parseable timestamp are conservatively kept. This is a
///    best-effort mode: `ScheduleBackup` carries no timestamp, so schedules are always
///    retained when filtering by `since` alone.
/// 3. If neither is given, the full current snapshot is captured and written out as-is.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `broker_url` - Broker connection URL
/// * `output_path` - Output file path (should end with .tar.gz)

/// * `since` - Optional RFC 3339 timestamp, used only when `previous_backup_path` is `None`
/// * `allow_empty` - When `false` (the default from the CLI), a capture that finds zero
