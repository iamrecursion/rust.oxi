//! Task simulation and load-testing command.
//!
//! This module generates synthetic task load against a queue so operators can
//! benchmark throughput, validate autoscaling, and exercise back-pressure
//! handling without writing a bespoke producer. The load is described by a
//! [`LoadTestConfig`] (total count, target rate, duration cap, task name,
//! payload size, and an [`ArrivalPattern`]) plus a `seed`.
//!
//! # Pure, deterministic planning
//!
//! The non-trivial part of the command — turning a configuration into an
//! ordered schedule of *when* each synthetic task fires and *what* it contains
//! — is implemented as the **pure** function [`plan_loadtest`]. Given a
//! [`LoadTestConfig`] it returns a [`LoadPlan`]: an ordered list of
//! [`ScheduledTask`] entries, each carrying an `offset_ms` (milliseconds after
//! start) and a fully-formed [`SyntheticTask`].
//!
//! Determinism is a hard requirement: the same configuration (including the
//! same `seed`) always yields byte-for-byte the same plan. No wall-clock or OS
//! randomness leaks into the planned schedule. Any "randomness" in the
//! [`ArrivalPattern::Jittered`] / [`ArrivalPattern::Poisson`] patterns is
//! derived from the seed via a small [`SplitMix64`] generator, so plans are
//! fully reproducible and unit-testable without a live broker.
//!
//! # Thin enqueue loop
//!
//! The async [`run_loadtest`] wrapper keeps broker interaction minimal: it
//! builds the plan with [`plan_loadtest`], and then either prints it
//! (`--dry-run`) or walks the schedule, sleeping until each entry's `offset_ms`
//! before enqueuing the corresponding task through the broker. The synthetic
//! [`SyntheticTask`] is converted to a real [`SerializedTask`] only at that
//! point, so the random task UUID assigned by `TaskMetadata::new` never
//! participates in the asserted plan math.

///   with this shared secret before being enqueued. Without this, a worker
