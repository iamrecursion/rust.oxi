//! Task replay command: re-execute failed / dead-letter-queue tasks.
//!
//! This module re-enqueues failed tasks that have landed in the Dead Letter
//! Queue (DLQ) back onto their target queue. Tasks can be selected by:
//!
//! - a specific task id ([`ReplayFilter::Id`]),
//! - a name/glob pattern ([`ReplayFilter::Pattern`]), or
//! - all DLQ entries ([`ReplayFilter::All`]).
//!
//! The selection / planning logic is intentionally separated from any network
//! or broker interaction. [`plan_replay`] is a **pure** function that, given a
//! list of candidate DLQ entries, a [`ReplayFilter`], and an optional limit,
//! produces an ordered [`ReplayPlan`]. This makes the non-trivial part of the
//! command fully unit-testable without a live broker. The async
//! [`replay_dlq`] wrapper keeps the broker calls thin: it fetches DLQ entries,
//! delegates ordering/filtering to [`plan_replay`], and then either prints the
//! plan (`--dry-run`) or re-enqueues each selected task via the existing
//! [`RedisBroker::replay_from_dlq`] plumbing.
