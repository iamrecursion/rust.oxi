## v0.3.0 Stub Elimination (2026-05-29)

### Real System Metrics ✅
- [x] `crate::sysinfo` module — real /proc readers for memory and CPU time (Linux); conservative fallbacks on other platforms
  - [x] `read_process_memory_bytes()` — VmRSS from /proc/self/status
  - [x] `read_total_memory_bytes()` — MemTotal from /proc/meminfo
  - [x] `read_process_cpu_time()` — cumulative utime+stime from /proc/self/stat
  - [x] `clock_ticks_per_sec()` — SC_CLK_TCK via libc::sysconf
- [x] `task_resources::TaskResourceTracker::get_current_memory()` — replaced mock-0 with `sysinfo::read_process_memory_bytes()`
- [x] `task_resources::TaskResourceTracker` — added `initial_cpu: Option<Duration>` field; `stop()` now reports real process CPU time delta consumed during the task window; removed dead `cpu_samples: Vec<Duration>` field
- [x] `resource_tracker::ResourceTracker::get_memory_usage_mb()` — replaced duplicated /proc reader with `sysinfo` delegation
- [x] `resource_tracker::ResourceTracker::get_cpu_usage_percent_async()` — replaced 0.0 placeholder with delta-sampled CPU% (`Arc<Mutex<Option<(Duration, Instant)>>>` interior state); multi-core aware (may exceed 100%)

### Real Autoscaling Inputs ✅
- [x] `WorkerPool::queue_depth: Arc<AtomicUsize>` — shared counter; `set_queue_depth(usize)` API for broker-layer integration; `queue_depth_handle() -> Arc<AtomicUsize>` for direct handle sharing
- [x] `start_scaling_monitor()` — replaced hardcoded `queue_depth=0, cpu=0.0, memory=0.0` with live readings from `sysinfo` and the `queue_depth` atomic
- [x] `compute_scaling_decision()` free function — extracted single canonical implementation replacing two duplicated methods; both `WorkerPool::make_scaling_decision` and `WorkerPoolMonitor::make_scaling_decision` delegate to it

### All Scaling Policies Implemented ✅
- [x] `ScalingPolicy::LoadBased` — scale up when CPU or memory exceeds target; scale down when both fall below 50% of target (hysteresis band prevents thrashing)
- [x] `ScalingPolicy::Hybrid` — scale up when queue is deep *or* load is high; scale down only when queue is shallow *and* load is low
- [x] Unit tests for all new policy branches: `test_load_based_scale_up_on_high_cpu`, `test_load_based_scale_up_on_high_memory`, `test_load_based_scale_down_when_idle`, `test_load_based_no_scale_in_band`, `test_hybrid_scale_up_on_queue_depth`, `test_hybrid_scale_up_on_high_load`, `test_hybrid_scale_down_when_quiet`, `test_hybrid_no_scale_mixed_signals`, `test_set_queue_depth_and_handle`

## Bug Fixes (2026-07-11)

### Lock-Free Queue Correctness (QA/Hardening Pass)
- [x] `src/lockfree_queue.rs` `try_pop()` — fixed a real logic bug where a spurious `Steal::Retry` signal from `crossbeam_deque::Injector` was treated the same as a genuinely empty queue, which could make a worker see a false-empty queue under contention; found via Miri testing (not a data race — Miri confirmed the queue's `unsafe impl Send/Sync` is sound). Fixed by delegating to the already-correct `pop()`.
- Added `readme = "README.md"` to `Cargo.toml` package metadata
- Removed 2 unused dependencies: `anyhow`, `tempfile` (dev-dependency)

## Dependencies

- `celers-core`: Core traits
- `celers-metrics`: Metrics (optional)
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `tracing`: Logging/tracing
- `serde`: Configuration serialization

## Notes

- Worker is broker-agnostic (works with any Broker implementation)
- Metrics are optional via feature flag
- Health checks are always available
- Signal handling is Unix-specific (SIGTERM)
