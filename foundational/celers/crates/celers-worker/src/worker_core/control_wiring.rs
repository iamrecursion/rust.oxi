//! Remote-control wiring for [`Worker`](super::Worker).
//!
//! The builder methods that attach a control channel to a worker, plus the
//! assembly of the `ControlSurface` the control protocol dispatches against.
//! Split out of `worker_core.rs` to keep that file under the 2000-line ceiling;
//! this is the same `impl` block, so nothing about the public API changes.
