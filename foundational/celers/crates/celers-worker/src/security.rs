//! Message authentication and payload hygiene for the worker receive path.
//!
//! Both controls here are **opt-in and off by default**. A worker built from
//! [`WorkerConfig::default()`](crate::WorkerConfig) verifies no signatures and
//! redacts nothing, which is exactly what it did before this module existed.
//!
//! # Signature verification
//!
//! Set [`WorkerConfig::signature_verification`](crate::WorkerConfig::signature_verification)
//! to a [`SignatureVerification`] and every dequeued message is checked
//! **before dispatch** — before the revocation registry, the poison-pill
//! strike table, routing, or any other admission decision, so an unauthenticated
//! message can never seed worker-local state keyed on its own task id or name.
//!
//! A message that fails is not executed and not requeued:
//!
//! * with a dead-letter queue configured, it is recorded there with
//!   `failure_type = "signature_verification"` and rejected without requeue;
//! * without one, it is rejected without requeue — dropped.
//!
//! Either way a `task-rejected` event is emitted and
//! [`WorkerStats::signature_rejected`](crate::WorkerStats::signature_rejected)
//! counts it.
//!
//! The producer side is [`celers_core::task_security::sign_task`]; the two share
//! the projection in [`celers_core::task_security::signed_fields`], so what the
//! producer signed is exactly what the worker checks.
//!
//! ## Everything that enqueues must hold the key
//!
//! Turning verification on makes the signing key a *deployment-wide*
//! requirement: every component that builds a **new** message must sign it, or
//! that message is dead-lettered on arrival.
//!
//! * **Your application code**, wherever it enqueues — call
//!   [`sign_task`] on the task
//!   immediately before handing it to the broker. This is the one that matters.
//! * **`celers-beat`** does *not* enqueue: it is a schedule engine with no
//!   broker handle at all, so whatever your integration enqueues when a
//!   schedule fires is application code and follows the rule above.
//! * **`celers-cli`** moves existing messages rather than minting new ones —
//!   `task retry` and `dlq replay` re-enqueue the stored bytes, so a signed
//!   message stays signed and stays valid (`state` and `updated_at` are not
//!   covered by the MAC). The exception is `loadtest`, which mints synthetic
//!   unsigned tasks: a verifying worker will reject them.
//!
//! The worker signs its **own** enqueues automatically — retry attempts and
//! workflow continuations (chain successors, `on_success_link` targets, chord
//! callbacks) are freshly constructed messages, and it re-signs each one with
//! [`SignatureVerification::sign`]. Without that, switching verification on
//! would kill every retry and every chain at the first hop.
//!
//! ## Freshness, replay and redelivery
//!
//! [`SignatureVerification::with_freshness`] and
//! [`SignatureVerification::with_replay_guard`] both reason about a message
//! being seen *once*. CeleRS is an at-least-once system, so several paths hand
//! the **same bytes** — same `signed_at`, same nonce — back to the broker:
//!
//! * an admission deferral (routing, affinity, feature flags, rate limiting)
//!   requeues the delivery;
//! * a graceful-shutdown drain requeues whatever was still in flight;
//! * the broker redelivers after a lost worker or an expired visibility
//!   timeout.
//!
//! On the next delivery a replay guard reports
//! [`SignatureError::Replayed`] and a narrow freshness window reports
//! [`SignatureError::Stale`], and the message is dead-lettered rather than run.
//! **Retries are not affected** — the worker re-signs those with a fresh nonce.
//!
//! So: enable a replay guard only where those paths do not occur (no admission
//! deferrals configured, an ack-on-delivery broker), or accept that a deferred
//! or redelivered message lands in the DLQ. For everything else, prefer
//! [`with_freshness`](SignatureVerification::with_freshness) with a window
//! comfortably longer than your longest deferral and shutdown drain.
//!
//! # Payload hygiene
//!
//! Set [`WorkerConfig::payload_hygiene`](crate::WorkerConfig::payload_hygiene)
//! to a [`PayloadHygiene`](celers_core::task_security::PayloadHygiene) and the
//! worker redacts secret-looking keys and masks
//! PII in the payload **copies** it shows to operators:
//!
//! * the bounded payload preview `inspect active` reports, and
//! * the worker's own `debug!` rendering of a task's arguments.
//!
//! It never touches the payload a task executes, and it is deliberately **not**
//! applied to dead-letter entries: a DLQ entry is replayable, so its payload is
//! an executing payload. `celers` does not persist task arguments to a result
//! backend at all, so there is nothing to redact there either — an integration
//! that adds one must call
//! [`PayloadHygiene::redact_payload`](celers_core::task_security::PayloadHygiene::redact_payload)
//! itself.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use celers_core::task_security::PayloadHygiene;
//! use celers_core::task_signature::TaskSigner;
//! use celers_worker::{SignatureVerification, WorkerConfig};
//!
//! let config = WorkerConfig::builder()
//!     .signature_verification(SignatureVerification::new(TaskSigner::new(
//!         std::env::var("CELERS_TASK_SIGNING_KEY").unwrap_or_default(),
//!     )))
//!     .payload_hygiene(PayloadHygiene::recommended())
//!     .build_unchecked();
//! # let _ = config;
//! ```
