//! Task prefetching to reduce latency
//!
//! This module provides task prefetching capabilities to reduce latency by fetching
//! tasks from the broker before they're needed. This minimizes the time workers spend
//! waiting for tasks to be dequeued.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Real buffering**: [`PrefetchBuffer`] holds the actual prefetched
//!   [`BrokerMessage`]s (a FIFO queue), not just a count
//! - **Configurable prefetch count**: Control how many tasks to keep ready
//! - **Adaptive prefetching**: Automatically adjust prefetch behavior based on
//!   *recent* hit rate and processing speed (a sliding window, not a
//!   lifetime average that would go stale on a long-running worker)
//! - **Graceful shutdown**: [`PrefetchBuffer::drain`] hands back any
//!   still-buffered messages instead of silently discarding them
//! - **Batch integration**: Works seamlessly with batch dequeue
//!
//! # Status: a building block, not part of the worker's dequeue loop
//!
//! This is a **standalone component for callers building their own consume
//! loop**. [`Worker`](crate::Worker) does not use it, and that is a decision
//! rather than an omission — the two designs solve the same problem in
//! incompatible ways:
//!
//! * The worker's loop acquires its concurrency permits **before** it dequeues
//!   (see `worker_core`'s `run_loop_inner`), so a saturated worker stops
//!   pulling messages out of the broker instead of accumulating them in RAM.
//!   That is the loop's entire backpressure story, and it is what keeps a
//!   crashed worker from stranding work it had reserved but never started.
//! * A prefetch buffer exists precisely to hold messages the worker has *no
//!   capacity to run yet*. Inserting one between the broker and dispatch would
//!   move the reservation boundary past the permits and undo that guarantee:
//!   messages would sit in this process, invisible to the broker's redelivery,
//!   for as long as the buffer is deep.
//!
//! What the worker ships instead is
//! [`WorkerConfig::enable_batch_dequeue`](crate::WorkerConfig), which fetches
//! up to `batch_size` messages per round trip — but only ever as many as it
//! holds permits for. That recovers the round-trip amortisation prefetching is
//! usually reached for, without the buffered-reservation trade. It is also what
//! the remote-control protocol reports as Celery's `prefetch_multiplier`.
//!
//! Use [`PrefetchBuffer`] when you are driving a broker yourself and want a
//! deeper reserve than in-flight capacity, and you accept that buffered
//! messages are reserved by this process. Do not expect `Worker` to consult it.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use celers_worker::prefetch::{PrefetchConfig, PrefetchBuffer};
//! use celers_core::BrokerMessage;
//!
//! # async fn example(fetch_from_broker: impl Fn() -> Vec<BrokerMessage>) {
//! let config = PrefetchConfig {
//!     prefetch_count: 10,
//!     adaptive: true,
//!     min_buffer_size: 2,
//!     max_buffer_size: 50,
//! };
//!
//! let buffer = PrefetchBuffer::new(config);
//!
//! // Check if we should prefetch more tasks, and if so, make sure only
//! // one prefetch round-trip is in flight at a time.
//! if buffer.should_prefetch().await {
//!     if let Some(_permit) = buffer.try_acquire_prefetch_permit() {
//!         let messages = fetch_from_broker();
//!         buffer.push_batch(messages).await;
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Workers pop real messages from the buffer instead of hitting the
//! // broker directly.
//! if let Some(message) = buffer.pop().await {
//!     // process `message`...
//!     let _ = message;
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
