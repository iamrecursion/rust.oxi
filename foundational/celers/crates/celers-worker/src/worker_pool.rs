//! Worker pool with automatic scaling
//!
//! This module provides a worker pool that can automatically scale up or down
//! based on queue depth and system load.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Automatic worker spawning based on queue depth
//! - Worker pool size limits and quotas
//! - Dynamic scaling policies (manual, queue-based, load-based)
//! - Worker health monitoring and replacement
//! - Graceful pool shutdown (drain, then abort stragglers)
//! - Bounded submission queue with real backpressure
//!
//! # Task distribution
//!
//! Submissions go through a single bounded MPSC channel whose receiver is
//! shared between workers behind a mutex: workers compete for the next task,
//! first-come-first-served. This is a **shared queue**, not work stealing —
//! there are no per-worker deques and nothing is ever stolen from another
//! worker. The distinction matters for latency expectations: each hand-off
//! costs a mutex hand-over, so exactly one worker at a time is parked in
//! `recv()` while the rest wait on the mutex.
//!
//! # Scaling signals
//!
//! Queue depth is supplied by the embedding application through
//! [`WorkerPool::set_queue_depth`] — the pool is broker-agnostic. CPU and
//! memory utilisation are sampled from `sysinfo` and are
//! [`Option`]al: a missing sample means *unknown*, never *idle*. An unknown
//! load signal can never trigger a scale-down, because "I cannot measure the
//! load" and "the load is zero" are very different statements.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use celers_worker::{WorkerPool, WorkerPoolConfig, ScalingPolicy};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! # async fn example() {
//! let config = WorkerPoolConfig::new()
//!     .with_min_workers(2)
//!     .with_max_workers(10)
//!     .with_scaling_policy(ScalingPolicy::QueueBased {
//!         tasks_per_worker: 5,
//!         scale_up_threshold: 10,
//!         scale_down_threshold: 2,
//!     });
//!
//! // Create and start the pool
//! // let pool = WorkerPool::new(config);
//! // pool.start().await;
//! # }
//! ```
