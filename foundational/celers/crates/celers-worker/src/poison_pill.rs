//! Poison-pill detection and quarantine
//!
//! A *poison pill* is a task that repeatedly fails or gets redelivered. Without
//! protection a broker will keep handing the same task back to a worker, which
//! burns CPU forever and can wedge an entire queue behind a single bad message.
//!
//! This module tracks per-task-id failure / redelivery counters and, once a
//! configurable threshold is crossed, *quarantines* the task: it is moved into a
//! holding set and marked for the dead-letter queue instead of being redelivered
//! again.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Each task id has a `FailureRecord` holding a monotonically increasing
//!   failure count, redelivery count, the timestamp of the first and most recent
//!   failure, and the last error message.
//! - [`PoisonPillConfig`] controls the quarantine threshold, an optional
//!   *decay window* (a record older than the window resets to zero on the next
//!   observation, so a task that fails sporadically over a long period is not
//!   treated as poison), and an optional hard cap on the size of the quarantine
//!   set.
//! - A successful execution clears the record for that task id, so a task that
//!   eventually succeeds is forgiven.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use celers_worker::poison_pill::{PoisonPillConfig, PoisonPillDetector};
//! use celers_core::TaskId;
//!
//! # async fn example() {
//! let detector = PoisonPillDetector::new(PoisonPillConfig::new().with_threshold(3));
//! let task_id = TaskId::new_v4();
//!
//! // Three failures trip the quarantine.
//! detector.record_failure(task_id, "boom").await;
//! detector.record_failure(task_id, "boom").await;
//! let verdict = detector.record_failure(task_id, "boom").await;
//! assert!(verdict.is_quarantined());
//! assert!(detector.is_poison(&task_id).await);
//! # }
//! ```
