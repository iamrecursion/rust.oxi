### Historical audit (unchanged)


`PostgresBroker::queue_name` (see the field doc comment in `src/broker_core.rs`) is a
**logical label stored in `celers_tasks.metadata->>'queue'`** — it is set at enqueue
time in `src/broker_trait.rs`'s `enqueue()`:

```rust
let mut db_metadata = json!({
    "queue": self.queue_name,
    "enqueued_at": chrono::Utc::now().to_rfc3339(),
});
```

It is **not** a real column on `celers_tasks` (or `celers_dead_letter_queue`), and it is
**not** a SQL table name. A number of peripheral (non-core-spine) functions across this
crate incorrectly assume one or the other. This section is a documentation-only audit of
every function found doing so, verified by direct grep/read of the current source. No
fixes are included here — see individual function doc comments / inline `TODO` markers
for anything already flagged in-code.

Two distinct bug shapes are tracked below:
- **(A) column drift** — filters `celers_tasks` (or the DLQ table) on `WHERE queue_name = $n`,
  a column that does not exist on that table. Fix direction: rewrite as
  `metadata->>'queue' = $n`.
- **(B) table-name drift** — interpolates `self.queue_name` directly into the SQL text as
  if it were a table name (via `format!("...FROM {}...", self.queue_name)`), instead of
  targeting `celers_tasks` (or, where a snapshot/queue table is genuinely intended,
  `celers_queue_snapshots`, which does have a real `queue_name` column). **Update
  2026-07-13**: since this crate's `sqlx` → `oxisql-postgres` migration (see CHANGELOG
  0.3.0, Pure-Rust Migration), the resulting string is passed as a plain `&str` to
  `oxisql_core::Connection::execute` — there is no `sqlx::AssertSqlSafe` wrapper (or any
  equivalent compile-time-checked-query safety net) anymore; this was verified directly
  against current `src/convenience.rs` / `src/query_optimization.rs`. The underlying bug
  (queue label spliced in as a table name) is unchanged, only the now-stale implementation
  detail below has been corrected. This is more severe than (A) — it doesn't merely miss rows, it
  can point at a nonexistent or wrong table entirely.

### `src/queue_ops.rs` — 2 functions (bug A)
- `search_tasks_by_jsonpath` (line 321) — filters `celers_tasks` on `WHERE queue_name = $1` — nonexistent column; needs `metadata->>'queue' = $n` rewrite.
- `find_tasks_by_metadata_filters` (line 396) — same `queue_name` column filter against `celers_tasks` — needs `metadata->>'queue' = $n` rewrite.

### `src/analytics.rs` — 20 functions (bug A), 2 of which also hit a second nonexistent column
All of the following filter/reference a nonexistent `queue_name` column on `celers_tasks` —
each needs the same `metadata->>'queue' = $n` rewrite:
`find_tasks_by_error`, `estimate_wait_time`, `get_worker_stats`, `get_task_age_distribution`,
`copy_tasks_from_queue`, `move_tasks_from_queue`, `get_hourly_task_counts`, `replay_tasks`,
`sample_tasks`, `aggregate_by_metadata`, `store_performance_baseline`, `compare_to_baseline`,
`get_distinct_task_names`, `get_task_breakdown_by_name`, `get_state_transition_history`,
`get_task_lifecycle`, `detect_abnormal_state_duration`, `get_state_transition_stats`,
`auto_adjust_priority_by_age`, `auto_adjust_priority_by_retries`, `apply_priority_strategy`.

Additionally:
- `copy_tasks_from_queue` (lines 373-424) — also references a nonexistent `timeout_secs` column on `celers_tasks` in its `INSERT` (lines 378/381) — needs either a real `timeout_secs` column or removal from the statement.
- `replay_tasks` (lines 529-596) — also references a nonexistent `timeout_secs` column on `celers_tasks` in its `INSERT` (lines 534/537) — same fix direction as above.

### `src/advanced_ops.rs` — 15 functions (bug A)
All of the following filter `celers_tasks` on a nonexistent `queue_name` column — needs `metadata->>'queue' = $n` rewrite:
`rebalance_queue_priorities`, `forecast_queue_depth`, `get_queue_trend_analysis`,
`estimate_task_completion_time`, `get_queue_capacity_analysis`, `search_tasks`,
`find_tasks_by_complex_criteria`, `count_tasks_matching`, `add_tasks_to_group`,
`get_task_group_status`, `get_tasks_in_group`, `cancel_task_group`, `tag_tasks`,
`find_tasks_by_tag`, `get_all_tags`, `get_tag_statistics`.

**Correction vs. an earlier draft of this investigation**: the task-group functions
(`add_tasks_to_group`, `get_task_group_status`, `get_tasks_in_group`, `cancel_task_group`)
do **not** reference a missing `celers_task_groups` table — verified via
`grep -n "celers_task_group" crates/celers-broker-postgres/src/advanced_ops.rs`, which
returns zero matches. They query `celers_tasks` directly, e.g.
`WHERE queue_name = $2 AND id = ANY($3)` combined with a
`metadata->>'task_group_id'`/`jsonb_set(... '{task_group_id}' ...)` filter — task-group
membership is correctly tracked via a JSON field, not a separate table. So this is just
another instance of bug (A), not a missing-table issue. `create_task_group` itself
(line 902) does not touch `queue_name` or the database at all — it only generates a UUID
and logs it, relying on `add_tasks_to_group` for the actual metadata tagging — so it is
omitted from the function list above.

### `src/convenience.rs` — 10 functions (bug A) + 8 functions (bug B)

Bug A (filters `celers_tasks` on nonexistent `queue_name` column via `.bind(&self.queue_name)`
next to a `queue_name = $n` clause) — needs `metadata->>'queue' = $n` rewrite:
`expire_tasks_by_ttl`, `expire_all_tasks_by_ttl`, `get_task_percentiles`, `get_slowest_tasks`,
`get_task_rate`, `boost_task_priority`, `set_task_priority`, `cancel_with_reason`,
`cancel_batch_with_reason`, `get_cancellation_reasons`.

Bug B (interpolates `self.queue_name` as a table name via a plain `format!("...FROM {} ..." /
"...UPDATE {} ...", self.queue_name)` string passed to `self.conn.query`/`.execute` — confirmed by
the source's own comment at `convenience.rs:366`: "`sqlx::AssertSqlSafe` itself drops away: oxisql's
`query` takes `&str` directly"; see the "Update 2026-07-13" note above) —
needs to target `celers_tasks` directly (or `celers_queue_snapshots`, which legitimately has
a real `queue_name` column, if that was the actual intent for any snapshot-related call site):
`find_tasks_by_priority_range`, `cancel_old_pending`, `batch_cancel`, `find_stuck_tasks`,
`requeue_stuck_tasks`, `get_queue_depth_by_priority`, `get_throughput_stats`,
`get_avg_task_duration_by_name`.

Note: `get_dlq_stats_by_task`, `get_dlq_error_patterns`, and `get_recent_dlq_tasks` are
**not** listed above — they were fixed in a separate, concurrent pass (deduplication work)
this round. Each of those three still carries its own `WHERE queue_name = $1` filter
against `celers_dead_letter_queue` (which also has no such column) as a known, separately
tracked issue — flagged in-code via an inline `// TODO(queue-name-drift): ...` comment
directly above each query in `src/convenience.rs`.

### `src/scheduling.rs` — 6 functions (bug B)
All interpolate `self.queue_name` as a table name:
`schedule_periodic_task`, `list_periodic_schedules`, `cancel_periodic_schedule`,
`create_queue_snapshot`, `archive_by_criteria`, `apply_retention_policies`.

Nuance: `archive_by_criteria` and `apply_retention_policies` call
`validate_sql_identifier(&self.queue_name)?` before interpolating it. This prevents SQL
injection (since `queue_name` could otherwise carry attacker- or config-controlled
content into raw SQL text) but does **not** fix the underlying semantic bug of treating a
queue label as a table name — it is a partial mitigation of the injection risk only, not
a correctness fix.

### `src/query_optimization.rs` — 2 functions (bug B)
- `explain_dequeue_query` — interpolates `self.queue_name` as a table name via `format!("...FROM {}...", self.queue_name)` (plain string, no `sqlx::AssertSqlSafe` post-migration — see "Update 2026-07-13" note above); calls `validate_sql_identifier(&self.queue_name)?` first (line 29) — same injection-mitigation-only nuance as above, not a correctness fix.
- `get_query_stats` — interpolates `self.queue_name` (after `trim_start_matches("public.")`) into a `WHERE relname = '{}'` filter against the `pg_stat_user_tables` system catalog, i.e. it also assumes `queue_name` names a real table — but does **not** call `validate_sql_identifier` first, so it lacks even the partial injection mitigation the other functions in this list have.

### Security Hardening — v0.3.0 (verified against source 2026-07-13)
- [x] `validate_sql_identifier()` (`src/scheduling.rs`) — validates identifiers against
  `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` before interpolation; unit-tested (`validate_sql_identifier_accepts_valid_identifiers`,
  `validate_sql_identifier_rejects_invalid_identifiers`, including a `'; DROP TABLE users;--` case)
- [x] `apply_retention_policies` (`src/queue_ops.rs`) parses its task-state filter through the
  closed-vocabulary `DbTaskState` enum (`policy.task_state.parse()?`) instead of splicing the raw
  string into the generated `WHERE` clause
- [x] `find_tasks_by_metadata_filters` (`src/queue_ops.rs`) binds both the JSON key and the value as
  parameters (`metadata->$n = $n+1`) instead of interpolating the key into the query text
- Scope note: these are real, targeted hardening fixes, not a resolution of the broader
  "queue_name schema drift" bugs (A)/(B) audited above — `validate_sql_identifier` mitigates SQL
  injection at the call sites that use it, but does not make `queue_name` a real column or fix the
  table-name-as-queue-label confusion; see that section for the still-open correctness issues.

  single multiplexed connection, not a real N-connection pool like the previous `sqlx::PgPool` — a
  known, tracked perf follow-up (see CHANGELOG "Known Limitations"), not a regression fixed here.
- [x] URL-driven TLS mode (`sslmode` query param honored again as of v0.3.0 — `src/tls_mode.rs`; the
  initial oxisql port had silently hardcoded `TlsMode::Disabled` at every connect call site)

### Task Result Storage ✅
- [x] `celers_broker_results` table (migration `009_broker_results.sql`) —

  verified via `Cargo.toml` and source on 2026-07-13, zero `sqlx` dependency remains)
- `oxitls` / `rustls`: TLS support (URL-driven `sslmode` parsing, see `src/tls_mode.rs`)
- `serde_json`: Task serialization
- `tracing`: Logging

## PostgreSQL Configuration

Recommended settings:
```sql
-- Connection pooling
max_connections = 100

-- Query performance
shared_buffers = 256MB
effective_cache_size = 1GB
work_mem = 16MB

-- Autovacuum
autovacuum = on
autovacuum_naptime = 60s

-- Logging
log_min_duration_statement = 1000
```

## Schema Design

### Tasks Table
- `id`: UUID primary key
- `name`: Task type identifier
- `payload`: JSONB task data
- `state`: Enum (pending/processing/completed/failed)
- `priority`: Integer for ordering
- `created_at`: Timestamp
- `retries`: Current retry count
- `max_retries`: Maximum allowed retries
- `timeout_secs`: Task timeout

### Indexes
- `(state, priority DESC)` for efficient dequeue
- `created_at` for archiving queries
- Consider GIN index on `payload` for searches

## Notes

- Uses PostgreSQL FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED for atomic dequeue
- Supports concurrent workers safely
- JSONB payload allows flexible task data
- Priority ordering for task selection
- Transaction-based operations for consistency
- Automatic retry handling via reject()
