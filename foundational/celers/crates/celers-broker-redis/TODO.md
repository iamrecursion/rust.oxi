    xxHash digest (`// Use a simple hash for now (could use xxhash crate)`). This is a **different**
    module from `partitioning.rs`'s `HashAlgorithm::XxHash`, which genuinely was fixed in v0.3.0 to
    use real xxHash64 via `twox-hash` (see Security/Data Integrity fixes below) — do not conflate the
    two. Verified by direct source read on 2026-07-13; not fabricated, not fixed by this release.
  - [x] SHA256 (cryptographically secure) — **fixed in 0.3.1**: `ChecksumAlgorithm::Sha256::compute()`
    in `src/integrity.rs` now computes a real SHA-256 digest via the `sha2` crate (added to this
    crate's `Cargo.toml`) and renders it as 64 lowercase hex characters through `hex::encode`. It was
    previously a `DefaultHasher` placeholder zero-padded to look like a SHA-256 digest, and then an
    honest `Err`. Pinned by FIPS 180-4 known-answer vectors plus a wrap/validate tamper-detection
    round trip in `integrity::tests`.

## Proposed Enhancements for v0.1.8+

  - [x] Trace context propagation (TracingContext)
  - [x] Span builder with fluent API
  - [x] Baggage propagation
  - [x] JSON serialization for Redis storage

  - [x] Automatic span creation for all broker operations (OtelBrokerInstrumentation)
  - [x] Integration framework for opentelemetry-rust crate
  - [x] Integration with popular tracing backends (Jaeger, Zipkin, Tempo, OTLP)
  - [x] W3C Trace Context propagation (traceparent header)
  - [x] Configurable exporters and sampling
- [x] Structured logging enhancements ✅ (v0.1.8)
  - [x] Contextual logging with task IDs (LogContext)
  - [x] Log correlation across distributed systems (correlation_id)

    (transient vs. permanent) from its real recorded failure reason and prioritizes transient failures
    first, skipping permanent ones — previously it used a single fixed strategy regardless of failure
    type. DLQ analytics (`src/dlq_analytics.rs`) likewise now classify errors and build error
    signatures (`classify_error`, `extract_error_signature`) from the real recorded task failure
    message rather than a simplified placeholder. Verified against source on 2026-07-13.

  - [x] Field-level selective encryption

    "cipher" — any ciphertext "decrypted" successfully with no integrity check at all. Now genuine
    AES-256-GCM / ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD via the `aes-gcm` / `chacha20poly1305` crates, wrapping the
