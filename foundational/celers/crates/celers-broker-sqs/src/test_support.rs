//! Test-only construction of `aws_sdk_sqs::Client` values that own no TLS stack.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Several unit tests need a `Client` *value* — to pass to
//! [`VisibilityHeartbeat::spawn`](crate::VisibilityHeartbeat::spawn), or to put
//! in [`SqsBroker::client`](crate::SqsBroker) so that
//! [`is_connected`](crate::SqsBroker::is_connected) has something to report —
//! but none of them ever issues a request.
//!
//! Building that value the obvious way is surprisingly expensive and, worse,
//! flaky. `Client::from_conf` calls `HttpClient::validate_base_client_config`
//! on whichever HTTP client the base config selects, and
//! `aws-smithy-http-client` deliberately materialises its TCP connector there:
//!
//! ```text
//! // Initialize the TCP connector at this point so that native certs load
//! // at client initialization time instead of upon first request.
//! ```
//!
//! That path ends in `rustls_native_certs::load_native_certs()`. On macOS the
//! Security-framework walk costs roughly twelve seconds *per process*, and
//! under the concurrency of a full `cargo nextest run --workspace` several
//! processes hit it at once and some come back with **zero** certificates —
//! which trips `debug_assert!(valid > 0, "TrustStore configured to enable
//! native roots but no valid root certificates parsed!")` inside
//! `aws-smithy-http-client`'s rustls provider and fails the test. Passing
//! alone, failing in the full run, for a reason that has nothing to do with the
//! code under test.
//!
//! The comment quoted above also names the escape hatch: the default client's
//! `validate_base_client_config` runs only when it is *the selected* client
//! ("it won't run if this is not the selected HTTP client for the base config
//! ... it was overridden by a later plugin"). Setting an explicit
//! [`http_client`](aws_sdk_sqs::config::Builder::http_client) de-selects it, so
//! no trust store is ever loaded.
//!
//! # What this does not change
//!
//! Nothing about the assertions. The tests that use [`offline_sqs_client`]
//! check exactly what they checked before; only the transport underneath an
//! object they never transmit through is different. A request *would* fail —
//! deliberately, with [`ConnectorError::io`] — but none of them makes one:
//! [`VisibilityHeartbeat`](crate::VisibilityHeartbeat) sleeps a full interval
//! before its first `ChangeMessageVisibility`, and the tests cancel it before
//! then.
//!
//! Live SQS coverage lives in `tests/localstack.rs`, which is gated on a real
//! endpoint and builds its clients normally.
