## AWS SQS Specifics

### Message Attributes
- **priority**: Stored as Number attribute (SQS doesn't natively support priority)
- **correlation_id**: Stored as String attribute for request-response patterns

### Long Polling
- Default wait time: 20 seconds (maximum allowed by SQS)
- Reduces empty receives and costs
- Configurable via `with_wait_time()`

### Visibility Timeout
- Default: 30 seconds
- Time window for message processing before redelivery
- Configurable via `with_visibility_timeout()`

### Queue URL Caching
- Queue URLs are fetched once and cached
- Reduces API calls to AWS
- Automatically refreshed on connection

## Implementation Details

### Message Format
- Messages serialized to JSON
- Compatible with Celery protocol via celers-protocol
- Message attributes used for metadata (priority, correlation_id)

### Error Handling
- AWS SDK errors mapped to BrokerError
- Automatic retry with AWS SDK defaults
- Connection errors properly propagated

### Authentication
- Uses AWS SDK credential chain:
  1. Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
  2. IAM role (recommended for EC2/ECS)
  3. AWS credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
  4. ECS container credentials
  5. EC2 instance metadata

## AWS IAM Requirements

Minimum IAM permissions needed:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
        "sqs:DeleteMessage",
        "sqs:ChangeMessageVisibility",
        "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
        "sqs:GetQueueAttributes",
        "sqs:ListQueues",
        "sqs:CreateQueue",
        "sqs:DeleteQueue",
        "sqs:PurgeQueue"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:*:*:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "cloudwatch:namespace": "CeleRS/SQS"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

For production, restrict `Resource` to specific queue ARNs.

**Note**: CloudWatch permissions are only needed if you enable CloudWatch metrics via `with_cloudwatch()`.

## SQS Limits

- Message size: 256 KB maximum
- Message retention: 1 minute to 14 days (default 4 days)
- Visibility timeout: 0 seconds to 12 hours
- Long polling wait time: 0 to 20 seconds
- Batch size: Up to 10 messages
- Queue name: Alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores (max 80 chars)
- FIFO queue throughput: 300 TPS (can increase with batching)
- Standard queue throughput: Nearly unlimited

## Cost Considerations

### Standard Queues
- $0.40 per million requests (first 1 million free per month)
- Requests include: SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage, etc.

### FIFO Queues
- $0.50 per million requests (first 1 million free per month)

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use long polling to reduce empty receives
2. Batch operations when possible (10x cheaper)
3. Adjust visibility timeout to avoid duplicate processing
4. Use IAM roles instead of access keys (free, more secure)
5. Consider message size (large messages cost the same as small)

## Notes

- SQS is a managed service - no infrastructure to manage
- Messages delivered at-least-once (standard queues)
- Messages delivered exactly-once (FIFO queues)
- Priority queues not natively supported (use message attributes)
- No broker topology (exchanges/bindings) like AMQP
- Ideal for cloud-native, serverless architectures
- Automatic scaling and redundancy
- **Pure-Rust dependency caveat**: this crate still pulls in `ring`/`aws-lc-sys` transitively via the AWS SDK (`aws-config`/`aws-sdk-sqs`/`aws-sdk-cloudwatch`) — an accepted, tracked, upstream-blocked limitation (see workspace `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.3.0]` Known Limitations), not a regression; no drop-in Pure-Rust AWS SDK exists yet in the COOLJAPAN ecosystem

## Usage Examples

### CloudWatch Metrics Integration

```rust
use celers_broker_sqs::{SqsBroker, CloudWatchConfig};

// Enable CloudWatch metrics publishing
let cw_config = CloudWatchConfig::new("CeleRS/SQS")
    .with_dimension("Environment", "production")
    .with_dimension("Application", "my-app");

let mut broker = SqsBroker::new("my-queue")
    .await?
    .with_cloudwatch(cw_config);

broker.connect().await?;

// Manually publish metrics (or call periodically)
broker.publish_metrics("my-queue").await?;
```

The following metrics are published to CloudWatch:
- `ApproximateNumberOfMessages` - Messages available in the queue
- `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible` - Messages being processed
- `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed` - Delayed messages
- `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` - Age of oldest message in seconds (useful for backlog detection)

### Adaptive Polling Strategies

```rust
use celers_broker_sqs::{SqsBroker, AdaptivePollingConfig, PollingStrategy};

// Use exponential backoff when queue is empty
let adaptive_config = AdaptivePollingConfig::new(PollingStrategy::ExponentialBackoff)
    .with_min_wait_time(1)
    .with_max_wait_time(20)
    .with_backoff_multiplier(2.0);

let mut broker = SqsBroker::new("my-queue")
    .await?
    .with_adaptive_polling(adaptive_config);

broker.connect().await?;

// Polling will automatically adjust based on queue activity
// - When messages are available: decreases wait time (more responsive)
// - When queue is empty: increases wait time (saves costs)
loop {
    if let Some(envelope) = broker.consume("my-queue", Duration::from_secs(20)).await? {
        // Process message
        broker.ack(&envelope.delivery_tag).await?;
    }
}
```

**Polling Strategies:**
- `Fixed` - Uses configured wait time (default behavior)
- `ExponentialBackoff` - Increases wait time exponentially when queue is empty, resets when messages arrive
- `Adaptive` - Decreases wait time when busy, increases after 3+ consecutive empty receives

### Parallel Message Processing

```rust
use celers_broker_sqs::SqsBroker;
use std::time::Duration;

let mut broker = SqsBroker::new("my-queue").await?;
broker.connect().await?;

// Process up to 10 messages in parallel
let processed = broker.consume_parallel(
    "my-queue",
    10,
    Duration::from_secs(20),
    |envelope| async move {
        // Your async processing logic here
        println!("Processing: {:?}", envelope.message);

        // Simulate some async work
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;

        // Return Ok(()) to acknowledge, Err to requeue
        Ok(())
    }
).await?;

println!("Successfully processed {} messages", processed);
```

**Benefits:**
- Concurrent processing of multiple messages
- Automatic acknowledgment on success
- Automatic requeue on failure
- Improved throughput for I/O-bound tasks
- Uses tokio's task spawning for true parallelism

### Health Check for Monitoring

```rust
use celers_broker_sqs::SqsBroker;

let mut broker = SqsBroker::new("my-queue").await?;
broker.connect().await?;

// Check if queue is accessible (useful for K8s liveness/readiness probes)
match broker.health_check("my-queue").await {
    Ok(true) => println!("Queue is healthy and accessible"),
    Ok(false) => println!("Queue is not accessible"),
    Err(e) => println!("Health check failed: {}", e),
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes
- Application startup validation
- Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Datadog, etc.)
- Circuit breaker patterns

### CloudWatch Alarms Setup

```rust
use celers_broker_sqs::{SqsBroker, AlarmConfig};

let mut broker = SqsBroker::new("my-queue").await?;
broker.connect().await?;

// Create alarm for high queue depth
let queue_depth_alarm = AlarmConfig::queue_depth_alarm(
    "HighQueueDepth",  // Alarm name
    "my-queue",        // Queue name
    1000.0             // Threshold (alert when > 1000 messages)
).with_alarm_action("arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:alerts");

broker.create_alarm(queue_depth_alarm).await?;

// Create alarm for old messages (backlog detection)
let message_age_alarm = AlarmConfig::message_age_alarm(
    "OldMessages",
    "my-queue",
    600.0  // Threshold (alert when oldest message > 10 minutes)
).with_alarm_action("arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789:alerts");

broker.create_alarm(message_age_alarm).await?;

// List all alarms for the queue
let alarms = broker.list_alarms("my-queue").await?;
println!("Alarms: {:?}", alarms);

// Delete an alarm
broker.delete_alarm("HighQueueDepth").await?;
```

**Alarm Features:**
- Programmatic alarm creation and management
- Pre-configured helpers for common scenarios (queue depth, message age)
- SNS integration for notifications (email, SMS, Lambda, etc.)
- Customizable thresholds, evaluation periods, and statistics
- Support for all CloudWatch comparison operators

**Common Alarm Scenarios:**
1. **Queue Depth Alarm** - Alert when queue has too many messages
2. **Message Age Alarm** - Alert when messages are too old (backlog)
3. **Low Throughput Alarm** - Alert when queue is empty for too long
4. **High In-Flight Messages** - Alert when too many messages are being processed

## Comparison with Other Brokers
