## Dependencies

**Production Dependencies:**
- `lapin` - RabbitMQ/AMQP client (v4.10.0)
- `oxihttp-client` - Pure-Rust HTTP client for Management API, TLS via `webpki-roots` (v0.2.0)
- `urlencoding` - URL encoding for Management API (v2.1)
- `celers-protocol` - Message types
- `celers-kombu` - Broker traits
- `async-trait` - Async trait support
- `tokio` - Async runtime (v1.52.3)
- `tracing` - Logging
- `serde_json` - JSON serialization

**Development Dependencies:**
- `celers-core` - Core types (required by the `amqp-events` feature during tests/benches)
- `tracing-subscriber` - Logging for examples (v0.3)
- `futures` - Stream utilities for examples (v0.3)
- `criterion` - Benchmarking framework (v0.8.2)

## RabbitMQ Configuration

Recommended settings:

```conf
# Enable lazy queues for better performance with large queues
queue_type = lazy

# Set memory threshold
vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.6

# Enable publisher confirms
channel_max = 2047

# Connection tuning
heartbeat = 60
```

## Celery Compatibility

This implementation is **100% compatible** with Python Celery's AMQP backend:

- Uses same exchange ("celery") and routing patterns
- Compatible message format (JSON serialization)
- Supports priority queues (x-max-priority)
- Follows Celery's queue naming conventions

## Notes

- Uses `basic_get` for polling (compatible with Redis broker pattern)
- Publisher confirms are automatic via lapin
- Priority queues require RabbitMQ 3.5.0+
- All queues are durable by default
- Messages are persistent (delivery_mode = 2)
- `list_queues()` available via Management API (requires configuration)

## Management API Features

The broker now supports comprehensive RabbitMQ Management API for advanced monitoring and management:

### Queue Management
- **list_queues()** - List all queues with basic information (name, vhost, messages, consumers, etc.)
- **get_queue_stats()** - Get detailed statistics for a specific queue (message rates, memory usage, etc.)
- **list_queue_bindings()** - List all bindings for a specific queue (source exchange, routing key, etc.)

### Connection & Channel Monitoring
- **list_connections()** - List all active connections (user, state, channels, peer info, traffic stats)
- **list_channels()** - List all active channels (number, state, consumers, unacked messages, prefetch)

### Exchange Management
- **list_exchanges()** - List all exchanges in a virtual host (name, type, durability, message stats)

### Server Monitoring
- **get_server_overview()** - Get RabbitMQ server overview (version info, cluster info, totals)

To use Management API features, configure the broker with:
```rust
let config = AmqpConfig::default()
    .with_management_api("http://localhost:15672", "guest", "guest");
```

## Performance Testing

Criterion benchmarks are now enabled! ✨ ENHANCED v5

Run benchmarks with:
```bash
cargo bench
```

Benchmarks include:
- Message serialization performance
- Queue configuration building
- Broker configuration building
- Batch operation sizing
- v4 Helper methods (QueueStats, ConnectionInfo helpers)
- v5 Monitoring functions (lag analysis, velocity, scaling suggestions, health assessment) ✨ NEW
- v5 Utility functions (batch size, memory estimation, pool sizing, throughput) ✨ NEW

For integration performance testing, use the example programs with timing:

```bash
# Test batch publish throughput
time cargo run --release --example batch_publish

# Test priority queue performance
time cargo run --release --example priority_queue

# Test transaction performance
time cargo run --release --example transaction

# Test streaming consumer performance
time cargo run --release --example streaming_consumer
```

The examples include built-in throughput measurements and timing information.

## Known Limitations

- Management API features require RabbitMQ Management Plugin to be enabled (enabled by default)
- Management API requires HTTP access to RabbitMQ (default port: 15672)
- Connection pool is disabled by default (connection_pool_size: 0)
- Channel pool is enabled by default (channel_pool_size: 10)
- The Management API HTTP client now uses `oxihttp-client` (Pure Rust), replacing the former `reqwest`-based implementation
- Still depends on `ring`/`aws-lc-sys` transitively via `lapin`; tracked as an accepted, upstream-blocked limitation pending a Pure-Rust AMQP client in the COOLJAPAN ecosystem — not a regression
