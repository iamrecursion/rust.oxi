//! Running a `celers_worker::Worker` against RabbitMQ.

//! [`AmqpBroker`] speaks the `celers-kombu` transport traits
//! (`publish`/`consume`/`purge`/...). A worker consumes
//! [`celers_core::Broker`] (`enqueue`/`dequeue`/`ack`/`reject`/...). This
//! module is the join: it teaches `AmqpBroker` the
//! [`celers_kombu::core_adapter::CoreBrokerTransport`] seam and re-exports
//! the resulting task-queue broker as [`AmqpCoreBroker`].

//! // `broker` is now a `celers_core::Broker`; hand it to `Worker::new`.
//! # Ok(())
