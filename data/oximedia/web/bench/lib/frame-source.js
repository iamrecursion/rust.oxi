/**
 * Wraps a raw RGBA8 buffer into a `FrameSource` the `scopes`/`color`/`scale`
 * wrappers accept (they all funnel through `_frame.js`'s `frameToRgba`,
 * which only understands `VideoFrame`, `HTMLVideoElement`,
 * `HTMLCanvasElement`, `OffscreenCanvas` and `ImageBitmap` — never a raw
 * typed array).
 *
 * Preference order: `VideoFrame` when the engine supports it (this is the
 * library's primary target — "WebCodecs gives you the frames" — and
 * exercises `frameToRgba`'s `copyTo(RGBA)` fast path), falling back to a
 * persistent `OffscreenCanvas` seeded once via `putImageData` (exercises
 * `frameToRgba`'s `drawImage` + `getImageData` fallback path instead). The
 * built source is reused across every warmup/measured call in a suite — it
 * is built once, outside the timed loop, exactly like a real integrator
 * would hold one frame and call a scope/pipeline method on it repeatedly
 * would not do, but which the source-acquisition cost model does not care
 * about: `copyTo`/`drawImage` do not consume or invalidate their source.
