## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
oximedia-playlist = "0.2.0"
```

```rust
use oximedia_playlist::playlist::{Playlist, PlaylistItem, PlaylistType};
use oximedia_playlist::schedule::ScheduleEngine;
use std::time::Duration;

// Create a new playlist
let mut playlist = Playlist::new("prime_time", PlaylistType::Linear);

// Add items to the playlist
let item = PlaylistItem::new("show_001.mxf")
    .with_duration(Duration::from_secs(3600));
playlist.add_item(item);

// Create a scheduling engine
let engine = ScheduleEngine::new();
```
