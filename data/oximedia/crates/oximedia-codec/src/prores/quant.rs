//! ProRes default quantization matrices (RDD 36 §6.5.4 Table 10).
//!
//! These two 8×8 matrices are used by every ProRes frame that doesn't
//! signal custom matrices in its frame header — which is the vast
//! majority of real-world streams. Custom matrices, when present, are
//! delivered inline at the end of the frame header.
//!
//! Layout convention: row-major, i.e. element at `[row * 8 + col]`
//! corresponds to spatial frequency `(row, col)` in the 8×8 DCT block.
//! Entry at `[0]` is the DC quantizer; bottom-right entries quantize the
//! highest-frequency coefficients.
