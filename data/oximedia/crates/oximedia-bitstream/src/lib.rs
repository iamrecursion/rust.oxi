//! Bit-level I/O for OxiMedia — a `std`-only fork of
//! [`bitstream-io`](https://crates.io/crates/bitstream-io) 4.9.0.
//!
//! `oximedia-bitstream` provides traits and structs for reading and writing
//! signed and unsigned integer values to streams that may not be aligned at
//! a whole byte.  Both big-endian and little-endian streams are supported.
//!
//! The crate is used internally by `oximedia-codec` for entropy coding
//! (FLAC predictor coefficients, Vorbis header parsing, AV1 OBU parsing, etc.)
//! and by `oximedia-container` for MP4 box I/O.
//!
//! # Core traits
//!
//! | Trait | Purpose |
//! |-------|---------|
//! | [`BitRead`] | Read bits from a stream, big- or little-endian |
//! | [`BitWrite`] | Write bits to a stream, big- or little-endian |
//! | [`ByteRead`] | Read whole bytes from a byte source |
//! | [`ByteWrite`] | Write whole bytes to any destination |
//! | [`FromBitStream`] | Deserialise a struct from a bit reader |
//! | [`ToBitStream`] | Serialise a struct to a bit writer |
//!
//! # Concrete types
//!
//! - [`BitReader`] — wraps any `std::io::Read` and exposes bit-level reads
//! - [`BitWriter`] — wraps any `std::io::Write` and exposes bit-level writes
//! - [`ByteReader`] — wraps any `std::io::Read` for whole-byte reads
//! - [`ByteWriter`] — wraps any `std::io::Write` for whole-byte writes
//! - [`BitRecorder`] (feature `alloc`) — records bits written for later replay
//! - [`BitsWritten`] — counts bits written without a backing writer
//!
//! Huffman coding helpers live in the [`huffman`] module via the
//! [`FromBits`](huffman::FromBits) and [`ToBits`](huffman::ToBits) traits.
//!
//! # Quick start
//!
//! ```
//! use std::io::Cursor;
//! use oximedia_bitstream::{BigEndian, BitReader, BitRead};
//!
//! let data = [0b1011_0100u8, 0b1100_1010u8];
//! let mut r = BitReader::endian(Cursor::new(&data), BigEndian);
//!
//! // Constant-bit-count read — validated at compile time (requires Rust 1.79+)
//! let high: u8 = r.read::<4, _>().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(high, 0b1011);
//!
//! // Variable-bit-count read
//! let low: u8 = r.read_var(4).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(low, 0b0100);
//! ```
//!
//! # Endianness
//!
//! Pass [`BigEndian`] or [`LittleEndian`] as a zero-sized type parameter
//! (or value) to [`BitReader::endian`] / [`BitWriter::endian`].  The endianness
//! is a compile-time phantom; switching endianness mid-stream requires creating
//! a new reader/writer around the same underlying stream.
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! | Flag | Default | Effect |
//! |------|---------|--------|
//! | `std` | yes | Enables `alloc` |
//! | `alloc` | via `std` | Enables [`BitRecorder`] |
//!
//! # Upstream attribution
//!
//! This crate is derived from
//! [`bitstream-io`](https://crates.io/crates/bitstream-io) 4.9.0 by
//! Brian Langenberger, licensed under Apache-2.0 / MIT.
//! The OxiMedia fork removes the `core2` / `no_std` compatibility shim
//! (OxiMedia targets `std` Rust only) and adapts the crate to the
//! OxiMedia workspace conventions.

//! # Traits and helpers for bitstream handling functionality
//!
//! Bitstream readers are for reading signed and unsigned integer
//! values from a stream whose sizes may not be whole bytes.
//! Bitstream writers are for writing signed and unsigned integer
//! values to a stream, also potentially un-aligned at a whole byte.
//!
//! Both big-endian and little-endian streams are supported.
//!
//! The only requirement for wrapped reader streams is that they must
//! implement the [`io::Read`] trait, and the only requirement
//! for writer streams is that they must implement the [`io::Write`] trait.
//!
//! In addition, reader streams do not consume any more bytes
//! from the underlying reader than necessary, buffering only a
//! single partial byte as needed.
//! Writer streams also write out all whole bytes as they are accumulated.
//!
//! Readers and writers are also designed to work with integer
//! types of any possible size.
//! Many of Rust's built-in integer types are supported by default.

//! # Minimum Compiler Version
//!
//! Beginning with version 2.4, the minimum compiler version has been
//! updated to Rust 1.79.
//!
//! The issue is that reading an excessive number of
//! bits to a type which is too small to hold them,
//! or writing an excessive number of bits from too small of a type,
//! are always errors:
//! ```
//! use std::io::{Read, Cursor};
//! use oximedia_bitstream::{BigEndian, BitReader, BitRead};
//! let data = [0; 10];
//! let mut r = BitReader::endian(Cursor::new(&data), BigEndian);
//! let x: Result<u32, _> = r.read_var(64);  // reading 64 bits to u32 always fails at runtime
//! assert!(x.is_err());
//! ```
//! but those errors will not be caught until the program runs,
//! which is less than ideal for the common case in which
//! the number of bits is already known at compile-time.
//!
//! But starting with Rust 1.79, we can now have read and write methods
//! which take a constant number of bits and can validate the number of bits
//! are small enough for the type being read/written at compile-time:
//! ```rust,compile_fail
//! use std::io::{Read, Cursor};
//! use oximedia_bitstream::{BigEndian, BitReader, BitRead};
//! let data = [0; 10];
//! let mut r = BitReader::endian(Cursor::new(&data), BigEndian);
//! let x: Result<u32, _> = r.read::<64, _>();  // doesn't compile at all
//! ```
//! Since catching potential bugs at compile-time is preferable
//! to encountering errors at runtime, this will hopefully be
//! an improvement in the long run.

//! # Changes From 3.X.X
//!
//! Version 4.0.0 features significant optimizations to the [`BitRecorder`]
//! and deprecates the [`BitCounter`] in favor of [`BitsWritten`],
//! which no longer requires specifying an endianness.
//!
//! In addition, the [`BitRead::read_bytes`] and [`BitWrite::write_bytes`]
//! methods are significantly optimized in the case of non-aligned
//! reads and writes.
//!
//! Finally, the [`Endianness`] traits have been sealed so as not
//! to be implemented by other packages.  Given that other endianness
//! types are extremely rare in file formats and end users should not
//! have to implement this trait themselves, this should not be a
//! concern.
//!
//! # Changes From 2.X.X
//!
//! Version 3.0.0 has made many breaking changes to the [`BitRead`] and
//! [`BitWrite`] traits.
//!
//! The [`BitRead::read`] method takes a constant number of bits,
//! and the [`BitRead::read_var`] method takes a variable number of bits
//! (reversing the older [`BitRead2::read_in`] and [`BitRead2::read`]
//! calling methods to emphasize using the constant-based one,
//! which can do more validation at compile-time).
//! A new [`BitRead2`] trait uses the older calling convention
//! for compatibility with existing code and is available
//! for anything implementing [`BitRead`].
//!
//! In addition, the main reading methods return primitive types which
//! implement a new [`Integer`] trait,
//! which delegates to [`BitRead::read_unsigned`]
//! or [`BitRead::read_signed`] depending on whether the output
//! is an unsigned or signed type.
//!
//! [`BitWrite::write`] and [`BitWrite::write_var`] work
//! similarly to the reader's `read` methods, taking anything
//! that implements [`Integer`] and writing an unsigned or
//! signed value to [`BitWrite::write_unsigned`] or
//! [`BitWrite::write_signed`] as appropriate.
//!
//! And as with reading, a [`BitWrite2`] trait is offered
//! for compatibility.
//!
//! In addition, the Huffman code handling has been rewritten
//! to use a small amount of macro magic to write
//! code to read and write symbols at compile-time.
//! This is significantly faster than the older version
//! and can no longer fail to compile at runtime.
//!
//! Lastly, there's a new [`BitCount`] struct which wraps a humble
//! `u32` but encodes the maximum possible number of bits
//! at the type level.
//! This is intended for file formats which encode the number
//! of bits to be read in the format itself.
//! For example, FLAC's predictor coefficient precision
//! is a 4 bit value which indicates how large each predictor
//! coefficient is in bits
//! (each coefficient might be an `i32` type).
//! By keeping track of the maximum value at compile time
//! (4 bits' worth, in this case), we can eliminate
//! any need to check that coefficients aren't too large
//! for an `i32` at runtime.
//! This is accomplished by using [`BitRead::read_count`] to
//! read a [`BitCount`] and then reading final values with
//! that number of bits using [`BitRead::read_counted`].

//! # Migrating From Pre 1.0.0
//!
//! There are now [`BitRead`] and [`BitWrite`] traits for bitstream
//! reading and writing (analogous to the standard library's
//! `Read` and `Write` traits) which you will also need to import.
//! The upside to this approach is that library consumers
//! can now make functions and methods generic over any sort
//! of bit reader or bit writer, regardless of the underlying
//! stream byte source or endianness.
