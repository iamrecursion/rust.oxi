#![allow(dead_code)]
//! Worker health monitoring — ping / heartbeat health checks, dead-worker
//! detection, and automatic restart policy.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! The [`HealthCheckRegistry`] maintains a per-worker [`HealthRecord`] that
//! tracks:
//!
//! - The timestamp and latency of every received heartbeat.
//! - A rolling success / failure window used to compute a `health_ratio`.
//! - The current [`HealthStatus`] (Healthy → Degraded → Unresponsive →
//!   MarkedForRestart → Restarting → Evicted).
//!
//! **State-machine transitions** are driven by [`HealthCheckRegistry::tick`],
//! which should be called periodically (e.g. every few seconds) by the
//! coordinator.  On each tick, workers whose last heartbeat is older than
//! `heartbeat_timeout` advance one step through the failure chain.  Workers
//! that recover (fresh heartbeat arrives while Degraded/Unresponsive) are
//! stepped back toward Healthy.
//!
//! **Restart policy** is expressed by [`RestartPolicy`] and is consulted when
//! a worker reaches `MarkedForRestart`.  The policy controls maximum restart
//! attempts and the back-off between attempts.
//!
//! ## No external I/O
//!
//! This module is intentionally pure-logic: it tracks timestamps and state
//! but does not perform any actual pinging.  The coordinator is responsible
//! for registering heartbeats (via [`HealthCheckRegistry::record_heartbeat`])
//! and acting on restart/eviction decisions returned from `tick`.
