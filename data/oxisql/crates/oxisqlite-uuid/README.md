# oxisqlite-uuid

UUID SQL function extension for the C-free **oxisqlite** engine — a Pure-Rust
fork of [limbo](https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo) 0.0.22, internal to the
OxiSQL workspace.

This crate provides the engine's UUID SQL functions, registered through the
oxisqlite extension API.

- **Role:** UUID SQL function extension.
- **Version:** 0.3.3 (2026-07-17).
- **Tests:** no dedicated unit tests in this crate; it is a thin extension
  validated indirectly — its SQL functions are registered
  (`register_extension_static`) into every `oxisqlite-core` connection when
  the `uuid` feature is enabled, and are exercised as part of
  `oxisqlite-core`'s `--all-features` integration suite (849 tests).
- **Approx LOC:** ~128.
- **Pure Rust / no C:** 100% Rust. No C allocator, no C parser generator, no
  `cc` / `build.rs`.
- **Internal:** private member of the OxiSQL workspace; not published separately.
