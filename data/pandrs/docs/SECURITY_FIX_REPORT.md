# PandRS Security Vulnerabilities Fix Report

> **Historical record, v0.2.0-era.** The `sql` feature and the `sqlx`
> dependency this report describes were **removed from PandRS in a later
> release** — there is no `sql` Cargo feature and no `sqlx`/RSA dependency in
> the current codebase (verified against `Cargo.toml`). The RSA/Marvin-attack
> mitigation described below no longer applies because its cause is gone.
> This file is kept as an internal engineering log, not a current security
> statement — see [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) at the repo root for the
> current policy.

## Executive Summary

This report documents the security vulnerability fixes applied to PandRS v0.2.0 to address known vulnerabilities in its optional dependencies.

## Vulnerabilities Identified and Fixed

### 1. RSA 0.9.10 - Marvin Attack (RUSTSEC-2023-0071)

**Severity:** Medium (5.9)
**Status:** Mitigated (Not Fixed - No CVE Fix Available)

#### Issue
RSA 0.9.10 contains a potential key recovery vulnerability through timing side-channels (Marvin Attack). This vulnerability is present in the `sqlx` library's MySQL backend (`sqlx-mysql`).

#### Solution Applied
- Made the `sql` feature completely optional (not enabled by default)
- Disabled sqlx's default features to prevent automatic backend enablement
- Configured sqlx to explicitly require "any" feature along with database backends
- Updated feature configuration to make `sql` an opt-in feature
- Removed `sql` from default feature bundles (`test-safe`, `all-safe`, `stable`)

#### Impact
- **Default Build (no features):** RSA is NOT included. Users building PandRS without features are NOT exposed to this vulnerability.
- **With `sql` Feature:** RSA is included as part of MySQL support. Users who explicitly enable the `sql` feature should be aware of this vulnerability.
- **Lock File:** Cargo.lock includes RSA as it tracks all optional dependencies that could be used.

#### Validation
```bash
# No RSA in default build
cargo tree --no-default-features | grep -i rsa  # Shows no RSA

# RSA appears only with sql feature
cargo tree --features sql | grep -i rsa  # Shows RSA (expected)
```

#### Recommendation
Users who do NOT need MySQL database support should avoid enabling the `sql` feature. For SQLite-only users, use `rusqlite` directly or contact the team for a sqlite-only variant.

### 2. paste 1.0.15 - Unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2024-0436)

**Severity:** Warning (Informational)
**Status:** Acknowledged

#### Issue
The `paste` crate (v1.0.15) is no longer maintained. This crate is a transitive dependency through:
- parquet 57.3.0 → paste

#### Solution
- No action taken (library upgrade not feasible without breaking changes)
- This is an informational warning, not a critical vulnerability
- The paste crate continues to function despite being unmaintained
- Newer parquet/datafusion versions may eventually fix this dependency

#### Validation
```bash
cargo audit  # Shows paste as a warning only
```

## Feature Configuration

### Default Features
- `default = []` - No features enabled by default
- Ensures zero critical vulnerabilities in standard builds

### Optional Features
- `sql` - Enables database connectivity (includes all backends)
- `parquet` - Parquet file support (includes paste warning)
- `distributed` - Distributed processing (recommended for large-scale analysis)
- `streaming` - Streaming data processing
- `excel` - Excel file I/O

### Bundled Features (for convenience)
- `test-safe` - Testing bundle without SQL to avoid RSA exposure
- `stable` - Stable features for production (without SQL by default)
- `all-safe` - All safe features (without SQL by default)

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Default Usage**: Use PandRS without additional features for maximum security (RSA-free)

2. **With SQL Support**: If you need database connectivity:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   pandrs = { version = "0.3.0", features = ["sql"] }
   ```
   Be aware this includes MySQL support with the RSA vulnerability.

3. **Lock File Understanding**: The Cargo.lock file may show vulnerabilities for optional features. This is expected behavior - the vulnerabilities only manifest if the features are enabled.

4. **Building Without SQL**: To ensure no SQL dependencies are compiled in:
   ```bash
   cargo build --no-default-features
   ```

## Testing and Validation

### Build Verification
- ✓ Default build compiles without RSA
- ✓ Build with `--features sql` compiles successfully
- ✓ All tests pass
- ✓ No new compilation warnings

### Security Audit Results
- **Default Build**: Zero critical/medium vulnerabilities
- **With All Features**: 1 informational warning (paste unmaintained)
- **Cargo Audit**: RSA appears in Cargo.lock but not in compiled binaries (when features not enabled)

## Technical Details

### sqlx Feature Configuration
PandRS uses sqlx with the following configuration:
```toml
sqlx = { version = "0.8.6", features = ["runtime-tokio", "any", "sqlite", "mysql", "postgres"], default-features = false, optional = true }
```

**Explanation:**
- `default-features = false`: Prevents automatic enablement of sqlx's default features
- `any`: Enables dynamic database type support (required for AnyPool)
- `sqlite`, `mysql`, `postgres`: Explicit backend enablement
- `optional = true`: Makes the entire dependency optional

### Why All Backends?
The codebase uses `sqlx::AnyPool` for dynamic database type support, which requires all backends to be compiled in for type inference. This is a fundamental architectural choice that cannot be changed without significant refactoring.

## Timeline

- **Identified**: RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (RSA) and RUSTSEC-2024-0436 (paste)
- **Analyzed**: Fundamental constraints of sqlx architecture
- **Mitigated**: Made SQL feature optional, documented impact
- **Validated**: Verified builds and security posture
- **Released**: Version 0.2.0 with security improvements

## Future Improvements

1. **sqlx Upstream**: Monitor for fixes to RSA or sqlx architecture changes
2. **Alternative SQL**: Evaluate alternatives to sqlx that provide better optional backend support
3. **Backend Separation**: Consider supporting sqlite-only builds if customer demand exists
4. **paste Replacement**: Monitor parquet updates to address unmaintained dependency

## Conclusion

PandRS v0.2.0 successfully mitigates the RSA vulnerability for default builds by making SQL support completely optional. Users who do not enable the `sql` feature receive a secure, vulnerability-free library. Users requiring database support should be aware of the RSA vulnerability when enabling the `sql` feature and can evaluate the risk/benefit for their use case.

**Bottom Line:** Default installations of PandRS are safe and vulnerability-free. SQL support is optional and must be explicitly enabled.
