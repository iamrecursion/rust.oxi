## [0.4.2] - Unreleased

Nothing yet.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **`stats::special`** — single, numerically-correct special-functions module shared across `stats` and `time_series`: Lanczos `ln_gamma`; Numerical-Recipes regularized incomplete gamma (`gser`/`gcf`) and incomplete beta (`betacf`); exact CDF / survival / quantile for the normal, Student-t, chi-squared and F distributions; unit-tested against published critical values.
- **`DataFramePlotExt` for `OptimizedDataFrame`** (`src/vis/direct/mod.rs`): `OptimizedDataFrame` now implements all 9 plotting methods (`line_chart`, `bar_chart`, `scatter_plot`, `histogram`, `box_plot`, `heatmap`, `area_chart`, `pie_chart`, `plot`) by converting to a standard `DataFrame` and delegating. Previously this conversion path was TODO'd and commented out.
- **Window-function validation in distributed schema validator** (`src/distributed/schema_validator/validation.rs`): `validate_window` now validates 18 known SQL window functions, checks that referenced partition/order columns exist in the schema, and verifies numeric type compatibility; previously was a `#[allow(dead_code)]` stub.
- **DataFusion optimizer rule translation** (`src/distributed/engines/datafusion/mod.rs`): pandrs `DistributedConfig` optimizer rules (`skip_failed_rules`, `enable_round_robin_repartition`, `prefer_hash_join`, `join_reordering`) are now wired through to DataFusion 53.1.0's typed `SessionConfig.options_mut().optimizer.*` fields. `enable_optimization = false` sets `max_passes = 0`. Rules without DataFusion toggles (`filter_pushdown`, `predicate_pushdown`, `projection_pushdown`) are documented as always-on in DataFusion 53.
- **`OptimizedDataFrame::linear_regression(y_column, x_columns)`** (`src/optimized/dataframe/stats.rs`, new module): fits an OLS regression directly against a columnar `OptimizedDataFrame`'s `Int64`/`Float64` columns, with no manual conversion to `DataFrame` first; uses complete-case (listwise) row selection when the target or an explanatory column is missing a value, and returns the same `LinearRegressionResult` (coefficients, R², adjusted R², p-values, fitted values, residuals) as `stats::linear_regression`. Also adds `MultiGpuManager::is_p2p_available()` and `GpuMemoryPool::device_id()` accessors.

### Changed

- Code-honesty audit recorded in `TODO.md` (verification of the "stub / fake-result / name-only-GPU" critique against PandRS, with a `file:line` remediation backlog).
- **`column_names()` returns `&[String]` instead of `Vec<String>`** (`src/dataframe/base.rs`): eliminates a heap allocation on every call; all call sites updated with `.to_vec()` where ownership is needed.
- **`Series<T>` idiomatic traits** (`src/series/base.rs`): added `Index<usize>`, `IntoIterator for &Series<T>`, `FromIterator<T>`, `Extend<T>`, and `Display` impls; `Column` gains `Display`. Targeted single-column construction replaces whole-object clones in `window.rs`/`categorical.rs`.
- **Lint hygiene** (`Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs`): demoted `unused_variables`/`unused_imports`/`dead_code` from `allow` to `warn` at workspace level; removed orphaned `src/ml/backward_compat/` dead files (~190 KB); fixed ~667 warning sites at root cause (no `#[allow]` silencing). Build is now warning-free.
- **Dependency updates**: `scirs2-core`/`scirs2-stats`/`scirs2-linalg` 0.5.0 → 0.6.5; `oxiarc-lz4`/`oxiarc-zstd`/`oxiarc-archive` 0.3.3 → 0.4.1; `pyo3` 0.25.1 → 0.29.0 and `numpy` 0.25.0 → 0.29.0 (py_bindings migrated to the new `Py<PyAny>`/`.cast()` API and the `#[pyclass(from_py_object)]`/`skip_from_py_object` opt-in required by pyo3's `FromPyObject` deprecation; no Python-facing API change); `cranelift`/`cranelift-module`/`cranelift-jit`/`cranelift-frontend`/`cranelift-native` 0.130.1 → 0.133.1.
- **`quick-xml` → `oxixml-quickxml-compat`** (`Cargo.toml`, `excel` feature): XLSX reading (`src/io/xlsx/reader.rs`) now resolves its XML parser through the COOLJAPAN OxiXML pure-Rust compat shim (`quick-xml = { package = "oxixml-quickxml-compat", version = "0.1.2" }`) instead of upstream `quick-xml`; the `quick_xml::` call sites are unchanged since the shim is API-compatible.
- **`aes-gcm` 0.10.3 → 0.11.0** (`src/config/credentials.rs`): `encrypt_data`/`decrypt_data` migrated from the deprecated `AeadInPlace` API (`Key`/`Nonce`/`Tag::from_slice`, which panics on a malformed length) to `AeadInOut`/`try_from`. This matters most for `decrypt_data`, whose nonce and tag are read back from stored credential bytes: a corrupted or truncated stored IV/tag previously would have panicked and now returns `Error::ConfigurationError`.

### Fixed — Statistical correctness (fabricated results → real computations)

- **`chi2_sf` continued-fraction sign bug**: the regularized upper-incomplete-gamma continued fraction used `an = i*(i-a)` instead of `-i*(i-a)` (and an inverted Lentz seed), so it returned ≈1.0 for essentially all inputs — i.e. **every** χ² test (Ljung-Box, Box-Pierce, Breusch-Godfrey, Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis, χ² independence/goodness-of-fit) reported "never significant". Fixed in both `stats/hypothesis.rs` and the duplicated copy in `time_series/stats.rs`.
- **Student-t CDF** (`distributions.rs`, `inference/mod.rs`): replaced an ad-hoc approximation that could return values **> 1** (an impossible probability) with the exact incomplete-beta form; t-test and correlation-test p-values are now correct.
- **F-distribution CDF / quantile** (`distributions.rs`, `inference/mod.rs`): the CDF saturated to 1.0 (collapsing ANOVA p-values to 0) and `inverse_cdf` returned a constant `1.0`; both now use the exact incomplete-beta form and a numerically-inverted quantile.
- **Chi-squared CDF / quantile** (`distributions.rs`): routed through the correct regularized incomplete gamma.
- **`TDistribution::ln_gamma`**: replaced a one-term Stirling approximation (e.g. `lnΓ(1) = −0.081` instead of `0`) that corrupted every t/χ²/F PDF, with the accurate Lanczos implementation.
- **OLS regression p-values** (`stats/regression`): now use the Student-t distribution at the residual degrees of freedom instead of the anti-conservative normal approximation.
- **Shapiro-Wilk real W coefficients** (`src/stats/hypothesis.rs`): replaced fabricated `0.7071`/`0.5/(i+1)` coefficients with the real Royston (1992) AS R94 algorithm — expected-normal-order-statistic `m_i` vector, polynomial corrections `a_i`, Royston p-value approximation. W values now match published reference values (e.g. n=5 sample → W≈0.984 vs. the former 0.943 stub).

### Fixed — Performance (allocation)

- **O(N²·C) → O(N·C)** in `dataframe/apply.rs`: `apply(Axis::Row)`, `duplicated`, and `drop_duplicates` re-materialized (full clone) every column once *per row*; they now extract each column a single time before the row loop.

### Fixed — DataFrame / Arrow / IO data integrity

- `DataFrame::to_arrow()` now converts real column data with correct Arrow types instead of fabricating values from the row index / column name.
- CSV/JSON/Parquet (de)serialization (`from_csv`, `to_csv`, `to_json`, `from_json`, `to_parquet`, `from_parquet`) read/write actual data instead of returning hardcoded `["Alice","Bob","Charlie"]`, `"{}"`, empty, or no-op results.
- DataFrame joins (`inner`/`left`/`right`/`outer_join`) perform a correct hash join (previously self-recursed / returned empty).
- MultiIndex `.xs()`/`.select()`/`.sort_index()` and `groupby(...).agg()`/`apply()` operate on real rows/values (were returning all rows / zeros).
- `is_numeric_column`, `is_categorical`, `filter`, `add_row` (fixes pivot), `head`, `set_index`/`set_multi_index` return correct results; `get_categorical` no longer uses an unsound `transmute`.
- Parquet schema-evolution rename preserves real data/type (was writing `"renamed_from_*"` literals); predicate pushdown is actually applied. Operations that cannot yet be done correctly (Arrow-kernel filter/sort, Arrow Flight receive, custom Parquet predicates) now return `Error::NotImplemented` instead of silently wrong data.
- **`Column::from_any` data-loss bug** (`src/core/column.rs`): `from_any` silently returned an empty `Int64Column` for every input (ignoring its argument), causing `clone_column()` to lose all data and mis-type every column. Fixed to correctly downcast `Box<dyn Any>` to the actual column type.
- **Path-traversal guard** (`src/connectors/local.rs`): `resolve()` computed `canonical_base` but never enforced it — `../` path traversal was not blocked. Now enforces `starts_with(canonical_base)` after lexical normalization; returns `Error::InvalidInput` on escape attempts.
- **`OptimizedDataFrame` → `DataFrame` conversion** (`src/optimized/convert.rs`, `to_standard_dataframe`/`standard_dataframe`): rebuilt each column as `Series<Option<Box<T>>>` instead of `Series<T>`, so typed access via `get_column::<T>()` on the converted frame failed to downcast (an error, or — at call sites that `.expect()` the downcast — a panic; not silently wrong data). Now builds `Series<i64>`/`Series<f64>`/`Series<String>`/`Series<bool>` directly, and NA is preserved rather than defaulted wherever a value type can express it: a NULL-free `Int64Column`/`BooleanColumn` still converts natively (`Series<i64>`/`Series<bool>`), but a column that actually contains a NULL is *upcast*, not defaulted — `Int64Column` → `Series<f64>` with `NaN` at the NULL positions (the same widening pandas itself performs for an integer column with NA), `BooleanColumn` → `Series<String>` (`"true"`/`"false"`/`""`). `StringColumn` NULLs become `""`, since `Series<String>` has no wider representation left to upcast to. No column with a real NULL is ever defaulted to a plain `0`/`false`.

### Fixed — Time series

- ARIMA estimates AR/MA coefficients from data (Levinson-Durbin) instead of hardcoded `0.5`/`0.3`; Augmented Dickey-Fuller runs the real OLS regression (t-stat on the lagged level); PACF uses the correct Durbin-Levinson recursion.
- Replaced fabricated p-value ladders with real distributions (χ²/t/F/normal via `stats::special`) across ADF, KPSS, Seasonal (ANOVA), Shapiro-Wilk (Royston AS R94), Anderson-Darling, Grubbs, Variance-Ratio and Runs tests.
- Savitzky-Golay, natural cubic-spline interpolation, seasonal fill, aggregation-aware resampling, and isolation-forest outlier detection are now genuine; `fractal_dimension` (Higuchi) and `lempel_ziv_complexity` corrected.
- STL/X-13 decomposition and Kalman/Hodrick-Prescott/LOWESS smoothing return `NotImplemented` instead of silently substituting a different algorithm.

### Fixed — Machine learning

- Model serving (`GenericServingModel`) performs real inference from stored weights (linear `wᵀx+b`; classification sigmoid/softmax) instead of returning hardcoded `42.0`/`class_a`; real probabilities, feature importance, and rmse-derived confidence intervals (or honest `None`).
- ML pipeline + legacy `backward_compat` transformers (`StandardScaler`, `MinMaxScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, `PolynomialFeatures`, `Binner`, `Imputer`, `FeatureSelector`) transform data for real instead of passing it through unchanged / using `std = 10%·mean`.
- `SelectKBest::FRegression` computes the genuine univariate F-statistic; `GridSearchCV`/`RandomizedSearchCV` refit and expose the best estimator.

### Fixed — GPU honesty

- GPU DataFrame/Series extensions (`gpu_corr`, `gpu_sum`, …) and matrix decompositions (`cuda_qr`/`svd`/`eigen`/`matrix_inverse`) return `NotImplemented` instead of the unchanged input, `0.0`, or identity/ones matrices; `stats::gpu`/`ml::gpu` linear regression solves the real normal equations (was `0.1·i`).
- Removed fabricated metrics (hardcoded `2.5×` "speedup", benchmark "speedup" column, hardcoded p-values) and fabricated device claims (P2P, `synchronize_all`); real cudarc-0.19 device queries; refreshed stale "cudarc 0.18.x" strings.
- **Non-CUDA GPU fallbacks return real CPU results** (`src/gpu/cuda.rs`): the `#[cfg(not(cuda_available))]` matrix-multiply / elementwise / reduce paths previously returned `Array2::zeros` (silent wrong data). Now compute real ndarray CPU results (`a.data.dot(&b.data)` for matmul, `a.data ± b.data` for elementwise, `a.data.sum()` for reduce, etc.).
- **Python GPU bindings compute real results** (`py_bindings/src/py_gpu.rs`): `gpu_corr` (Pearson correlation matrix), `gpu_pca` (real PCA fit+transform), `gpu_kmeans` (KMeans with real centroids/labels/inertia), `gpu_linear_regression` (OLS via DataFrame API), and `gpu_accelerate` (documented CPU pass-through) were all returning fabricated zeros/placeholders; all now compute real results.

### Fixed — Storage compression

- Real Pure-Rust **LZ4** and **ZSTD** via the COOLJAPAN OxiARC ecosystem (`oxiarc_lz4`/`oxiarc_zstd`). The previous engines (and the adaptive string pool) prepended a length byte and copied data verbatim — so "compressed" output was *larger* than the input — while reporting fabricated ratios (`2.5` placeholder / a `0.4`/`0.6` multiplier table). Compression ratios are now measured from real byte counts.

---

**2026-08-19 addendum — "Productionization" Waves 1-4.** The fixes above closed the June 2026 audit backlog; a second, independent, more exhaustive audit (recorded in `TODO.md`) then found and fixed a further round of correctness bugs and honesty gaps across the whole crate, in four waves. Verified end state: `cargo nextest run --features all-safe` → **2817 passed, 0 failed**; `cargo test --doc --features all-safe` → **110 passed, 19 ignored, 0 failed**; `cargo clippy --features all-safe -- -D warnings` clean; `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps` clean on both `all-safe` and the docs.rs feature set; `cargo deny check bans` → ok; `cargo check --features distributed,flight` clean; `cargo build --all-features` clean (CUDA auto-skipped on macOS by `build.rs`).

### Fixed — Data-path correctness (Waves 1-4)

- Query engine `&&`/`||` boolean combinators actually combine predicates now, instead of both operators returning every row.
- CSV/JSON writers write real data instead of emitting blank output.
- **GroupBy NaN handling and performance.** The typed/columnar `group_by(...)` aggregation path went from O(n²) to O(n) — independently re-measured at **~1040× faster wall-clock** on a quiet CPU with `groups == rows`, `n = 4000` (exact ratio depends on group cardinality; see `benches/`). Separately, the base `DataFrame::groupby_single(...)` path was found to *propagate* an `f64::NAN` cell through `mean`/`sum`/`std`/`min`/`max`/`first` (returning `"NaN"` for the whole group) where the typed path correctly *excludes* it — the base path now excludes NaN the same way (pandas `skipna=True`), and an all-NA group now reports NA (not a leaked `0.0`/`±INFINITY`) on both paths. A stale comment claiming "real NA values are unaffected by this change" — which the measurement contradicted — is gone. (`hierarchical_groupby.rs` was found to carry the identical NaN-propagation pattern and has since been fixed the same way, via a shared `parse_hierarchical_numeric_pairs` helper used by `calculate_hierarchical_aggregation`, `cross_level_agg`, and `nested_transform`; a non-numeric cell now errors loudly instead of being silently dropped via the old `.parse().ok()`. Covered by 9 new regression tests in `tests/hierarchical_groupby_nan_w4_regression_test.rs`, all passing.)
- `right_join` inversion fixed (it silently swapped which side was "right").
- `melt`/`stack`/`unstack` no longer fabricate placeholder ("dummy") output rows.
- `.iat` random-position access is O(1) (was O(n) per call, ~4.65ms at 4000 rows before the fix).
- `mean_simd`'s `Int64` arm computed a truncating *integer* mean before casting to `f64` (`[1, 2]` → `1.0` instead of `1.5`); fixed to sum in `i64` and divide once in `f64`, bit-identical to the non-SIMD reference. `min_simd`/`max_simd`/`mean_simd` on an all-`NaN` column returned `Ok(±INFINITY)`/`Ok(NaN)` where the non-SIMD reference returns `Err`; both paths now agree (`src/optimized/direct_aggregations.rs`).
- `gpu_rolling(...).mean()`/`.sum()`/`.std()`/`.var()`/`.min()`/`.max()` (`src/dataframe/gpu_window.rs`, behind `cuda_available`) return genuine `f64`-typed columns instead of `String`-typed ones; `.std()`/`.var()` now honor a caller-supplied `ddof` instead of a hardcoded `1`; `.min()`/`.max()` are implemented on the CPU-fallback path (previously always `Err("Fallback not implemented")`).
- `OptimizedDataFrame` ↔ `DataFrame` conversion (`src/optimized/convert.rs`) preserves NA correctly in both directions — see the "Fixed — DataFrame / Arrow / IO data integrity" entry above for the exact per-type conversion policy (NULL upcasts to a wider nullable type; only `String` NULLs become `""`, since there is no wider representation left).

### Fixed — Subsystem honesty (Waves 1-4)

- **Storage**: real file-backed tiers (a `thread::sleep`-simulated backend was removed) with correct `BlockId`/`DataId` write-then-read tracking; a use-after-free in the arena/zero-copy path was fixed.
- **Stats**: standard errors and hypothesis tests route through the correct `ddof`; `stats::special` (Lanczos `ln_gamma`, incomplete gamma/beta) is now the single source of truth shared with `time_series`.
- **Time series**: ARIMA integrates through a real estimation step; spectral/periodogram analysis is routed through **OxiFFT** (COOLJAPAN's pure-Rust FFT) instead of a placeholder.
- **ML**: `GridSearchCV`/`RandomizedSearchCV` perform a real search and refit the best estimator; preprocessing transformers (`StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`, `PolynomialFeatures`, `Binner`, `Imputer`) transform data for real; model serving performs real inference from stored weights.
- **GPU**: the fabricated Student-t CDF fallback is gone — `stats::gpu`'s fallback now shares the exact incomplete-beta CDF used by the CPU path, instead of an approximation standing in as if it were exact.
- **Distributed**: `ProjectionExt::validate_projections` (`src/distributed/expr/projection.rs`) returned `Ok(())` unconditionally — it validated nothing. It now type-checks each projection against the caller-supplied schema and rejects unknown-column references, blank aliases, and duplicate output names. Separately, `DataFusionContext::new`'s `RuntimeEnvBuilder::build_arc().unwrap_or_else(RuntimeEnv::default)` silently discarded a configured memory limit whenever the limited-runtime build failed, falling back to an *unlimited* runtime; a new fallible `try_new` propagates that failure instead (wired through `ExecutionEngine::create_context`), and the infallible `new` at least logs the fallback (`src/distributed/engines/datafusion/mod.rs`).

### Security (Waves 1-4)

- **ReBAC** (relationship-based access control): a cyclic relationship graph previously crashed the process (`SIGABRT`); resolution now uses a visited-set with a bounded `MAX_RESOLUTION_DEPTH` and returns `Ok(false)` instead of aborting.
- API keys are hashed at rest.
- JWT verification is real end-to-end.
- Constant-time comparison is used for credential/secret equality checks.
- Credential encryption (`src/config/credentials.rs`) carries AAD (additional authenticated data) on the AEAD cipher.
- Audit log entries are hash-chained.
- **Cloud connector HTTPS panic** (`src/connectors/cloud.rs`): the `object_store` 0.13.2 → 0.14.1 upgrade (below) switched `reqwest` to its `rustls-no-provider` mode; without a process-level `CryptoProvider` installed, the *first* S3/GCS/Azure/MinIO client build panicked (`No rustls crypto provider is configured`) instead of erroring. Fixed with a `Once`-guarded `rustls::crypto::ring::default_provider().install_default()` ahead of every `build_store` call. This path was previously untested (the existing connector tests only built configs and touched the local filesystem); regression tests now actually construct a cloud client per backend.

### Changed — Dependencies & release engineering (Waves 1-4)

- Added `deny.toml` (cargo-deny bans/advisories/licenses/sources); `cargo deny check bans` passes.
- `object_store` 0.13.2 → 0.14.1, closing **RUSTSEC-2026-0194** and **RUSTSEC-2026-0195**.
- MSRV is now honestly documented and enforced per feature bundle instead of a single blanket number: **1.88** for the default feature set and `distributed`; **1.89** for `cloud-storage`/`all-safe`/`stable` (a higher floor pulled in via `object_store`'s AWS backend). The workspace `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml` stays at the 1.88 floor; cargo enforces the higher per-dependency requirement automatically once a 1.89-needing feature is enabled.
- `Cargo.toml`'s `package.exclude` now trims the published crate to what a library consumer needs (529 files, ~9.0 MiB dry-run) — `TODO.md` and internal audit/scratch material no longer ship in the package.
- Added `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`; removed four `*.yml.disabled` placeholder workflows that were never going to run (repo policy permits only the release-publish workflows — see CONTRIBUTING.md's Review Process note).
- `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps` is now clean on **both** the `all-safe` feature set and the docs.rs feature set (`optimized,jit,distributed,serving,excel,visualization,parquet,streaming,backward_compat,resilience`, `--cfg docsrs`) — fixed ~47 broken intra-doc links across 28 files: path-qualified the genuinely-public targets (several had drifted after module splits), de-linked genuinely-private ones (prose kept, brackets removed), and corrected two links that pointed at methods that don't exist (`HttpResponse::from_error_code` → `from_status`; a `LogisticRegression::predict` inherent-method link → the real `SupervisedModel::predict` trait method).

### Changed — API hygiene (Waves 1-4)

- `pandrs::error` / `PandRSError` are now a **stable, non-deprecated** alias of `pandrs::core::error` (it was erroneously marked `#[deprecated]`).
- Removed three false "SQL / relational database connectivity" claims from the crate docs — this crate has no such feature (the `"sql"` string in `Cargo.toml` is an upstream DataFusion dependency feature, not a pandrs one; `src/connectors/` only ever had cloud/local file backends).
- The `prelude` module additionally exports `read_csv`, `write_json`, `JsonOrient`, `MeltOptions`/`StackOptions`/`UnstackOptions`, and `JoinType`.
- **Renamed** inherent `DataFrame::groupby(&str)` → **`groupby_pivot`** (`src/pivot/mod.rs`), so `df.groupby(&["col"])` in method syntax now resolves to `GroupByExt::groupby` (the multi-key trait method) instead of being silently shadowed by the single-key pivot method.
- **Renamed** `StatisticalAnalyzer::test_columns` → **`columns_ttest`**.
- The ~20 `Legacy*` aliases (`LegacyDataFrame`, `Legacy{Melt,Stack,Unstack}Options`, `LegacyJoinType`, `LegacyAxis`, …) remain exported and deprecated; **scheduled for removal in 0.5.0**.

### Fixed — Visualization (Wave 3)

- Charting a series that is entirely `NaN` no longer corrupts the SVG polyline or leaks a literal `"NaN"` into line/scatter/pie output.
- `nice_ticks` no longer infinite-loops on a huge, narrow axis range.

### Changed — Lints (Wave 4)

- Removed the crate-wide `#![allow(clippy::all)]` from `src/lib.rs`. `clippy::correctness` is now **denied**, `clippy::suspicious` and `clippy::perf` are **warned** (both clean on the library); `clippy::style` and `clippy::complexity` remain allowed as a deliberate, high-volume, purely-stylistic exception. Fixing the newly-surfaced findings included a real `Ord`/`PartialOrd` derive inconsistency on the multi-index ordered-float wrapper (`src/core/advanced_multi_index.rs`, regression-tested) and ~16 `perf`-flagged sites; a handful of findings got a narrow, individually-documented `#[allow]` at their exact site instead of a real fix (six `mut_from_ref` in the bump arena `src/storage/arena.rs`, where a sound bump allocator's contract genuinely requires it; one `arc_with_non_send_sync` in the JIT window cache, deferred to a 0.5.0 thread-safety redesign; `result_large_err` crate-wide, deferred to a 0.5.0 `Error`-enum size reduction since shrinking it now would be a breaking API change). See CONTRIBUTING.md for the full policy and the reasoning behind each residual allow.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed — ML/Statistical Correctness (replacing fabricated results with real algorithms)

- **`PCA` (always-compiled)**: Replaced zero-component stub with real Jacobi rotation eigendecomposition. `fit` now computes covariance matrix, decomposes it, stores real principal components and explained variance ratios. `transform` now correctly projects onto components (was: read String columns and rename). `evaluate` now returns real reconstruction MSE.
- **`TSNE` (always-compiled)**: Replaced all-zeros embedding with real t-SNE — perplexity-tuned high-D affinities, symmetrised P matrix, Student-t Q kernel, gradient descent with momentum and early exaggeration.
- **`DBSCAN::fit`**: Replaced all-zeros stub with real density-based clustering — ε-neighborhood queries, core-point detection, BFS region-growing, noise labelling (−1). Supports Euclidean/Manhattan/Cosine metrics.
- **`AgglomerativeClustering::fit`**: Replaced all-zeros stub with real bottom-up hierarchical clustering. All four linkage variants (Single/Complete/Average/Ward) over a precomputed pairwise distance matrix.
- **`compute_silhouette`**: Replaced hardcoded `0.75` with real mean silhouette coefficient (a = mean intra-cluster dist, b = min mean nearest-cluster dist).
- **`LogisticRegression::fit`**: Replaced zero-coefficient stub with real IRLS (Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) with L2 regularisation, honoring `max_iter`/`tol`/`c`/`fit_intercept`.
- **`LogisticRegression::predict`**: Real sigmoid threshold at 0.5.
- **`LogisticRegression::predict_proba`**: Real sigmoid probabilities.
- **`LogisticRegression::evaluate`**: Real confusion-matrix metrics (accuracy/precision/recall/F1) — was hardcoded `accuracy=0.85`.
- **`LogisticRegression::cross_validate`**: Real k-fold CV — was hardcoded.
- **`LinearRegression::cross_validate`**: Real k-fold CV — was hardcoded `r2=0.8`.
- **`IsolationForest::fit`/`predict`/`decision_function`**: Replaced RNG-fabricated scores with real isolation trees (random feature/value splits, path-length scores, `2^(-E[h]/c(n))` anomaly score, contamination-percentile labels).
- **`LocalOutlierFactor::fit`**: Replaced no-op stub with real LOF (k-NN, k-distances, reachability distances, LRD ratio, contamination threshold).
- **`OneClassSVM::fit`/`transform`**: Replaced RNG-fabricated scores with real SVDD kernel-distance scoring (RBF kernel, data-centered kernel distance).
- **`Scorer::RocAuc`**: Replaced hardcoded `0.75` with real AUC via Mann-Whitney U rank-based formula (ties handled correctly; perfect = 1.0, random = 0.5).
- **`SelectKBest::chi2_scores`**: Replaced all-`1.0` placeholder with real χ² contingency table statistic.
- **`SelectKBest::mutual_info_scores`**: Replaced all-`0.5` placeholder with real histogram-based mutual information.
- **`HyperparameterGrid::parameter_combinations`**: Replaced single-combo stub with real Cartesian product.
- **`GridSearchCV::fit`**: Replaced hardcoded `best_score=0.9` with real k-fold CV scoring via `cross_validate`.
- **`RandomizedSearchCV::fit`** (models/selection): Same — real CV with random subset of param combinations.
- **`learning_curve`**: Replaced hardcoded `0.9/0.8` with real per-size-fraction k-fold CV.
- **`validation_curve`**: Replaced hardcoded `0.9/0.8` with real per-param-value k-fold CV.
- **`select_features`**: All four strategies now data-dependent — `RecursiveElimination` (iterative OLS RFE), `L1Based` (coefficient ranking), `TreeBased` (variance × correlation), `MutualInformation` (histogram MI).
- **`create_scaler`**: `RobustScaler` (real median/IQR), `QuantileTransformer` (real rank-based normalization), `PowerTransformer` (real Yeo-Johnson with optimal λ) now returned instead of silently substituting `StandardScaler`.
- **Statistical p-values** (`stats/hypothesis.rs`, `time_series/stats.rs`): Added native `chi2_sf` (regularised incomplete gamma via Lanczos + Lentz continued fraction) and `normal_sf` (erfc approximation). Replaced binary-threshold p-values in Ljung-Box, Box-Pierce, Breusch-Godfrey, Friedman, and Kruskal-Wallis tests with real χ²-distributed p-values. Fixed Kruskal-Wallis to compute its own H statistic instead of forwarding Friedman's. Improved Shapiro-Wilk p-value approximation via Royston log-transform. Removed erroneous `× 0.95` scaling in Phillips-Perron test.

### Added

- `examples/ml_real_algorithms_example.rs` — end-to-end demo of PCA, DBSCAN, LogisticRegression, IsolationForest, LOF, and AgglomerativeClustering on synthetic data with correctness assertions.
- `IsolationForest.labels` field (public) — populated with `−1`/`1` labels after `fit`.
- `LocalOutlierFactor.labels` field — same.
- `OneClassSVM.labels` field — same.
- **SciRS2-Core policy compliance**: `scirs2-core` is now a non-optional core dependency
  with the `random` feature enabled. All direct `rand`/`ndarray` usages in production
  code have been migrated to `scirs2_core::random` and `scirs2_core::ndarray`, and the
  `rand_compat.rs` shim module has been retired. The `rand` and `ndarray` crates are
  no longer direct dependencies of pandrs (they remain transitive via scirs2-core).
  Migration covers GPU acceleration code in `src/gpu/` and `src/temporal/gpu.rs`.
- **Expanded SciRS2 stats integration** (`scirs2` feature):
  - Correlation: Spearman rank correlation matrix, sample covariance matrix
  - Hypothesis tests: paired t-test (`ttest_paired`), chi-square goodness-of-fit
    (`chi2_goodness_of_fit`), chi-square independence (`chi2_independence`),
    Mann-Whitney U (`mann_whitney_u`), Wilcoxon signed-rank (`wilcoxon_signed_rank`),
    Kruskal-Wallis (`kruskal_wallis`), Shapiro-Wilk normality test (`shapiro_wilk_test`),
    KS two-sample test (`ks_two_sample`)
  - New result types: `Chi2TestResult`, `NormalityTestResult`
- **Expanded SciRS2 linalg integration** (`scirs2` feature):
  - QR decomposition (`qr`), Cholesky decomposition (`cholesky`), LU decomposition (`lu`)
  - Least-squares solve (`lstsq`), pseudoinverse (`pinv`)
  - Matrix norm (`matrix_norm`), numerical rank (`matrix_rank`), condition number (`condition_number`)
  - New result types: `QrResult`, `LuResult`, `LstsqDataFrameResult`
- **`SciRS2Ext` DataFrame trait** extended with: `scirs2_spearman_corr`, `scirs2_cov`,
  `scirs2_qr`, `scirs2_lstsq`, `scirs2_matrix_rank`, `scirs2_condition_number`
- **Descriptive statistics**: `skewness` and `kurtosis_excess` free functions added to
  `stats::descriptive`, available without the `scirs2` feature
- **MultiIndex missing-value support**: `index::MultiIndex` now accepts `code == -1`
  (pandas-style NA sentinel) in the constructor. `get_level_values()` returns
  `Vec<Option<T>>` (None for -1 codes). New `get_tuple_opt()` method provides
  tuple access with per-level Option wrapping.
- **Model serving `load_model`**: `InMemoryModelRegistry::load_model` now returns
  `Arc<dyn ModelServing>` (previously `NotImplemented`). Storage changed from
  `Box` to `Arc` enabling reference-counted sharing. `update_metadata` also implemented.
- **JIT expression tree execution**: `execute_expression_tree` now implements a full
  recursive interpreter covering all `ExpressionNode` variants (Constant, Variable,
  BinaryOp, UnaryOp, Reduction, Conditional, FunctionCall, ArrayAccess) with
  scalar-broadcast semantics. `apply` in `JitOptimizedDataFrame` delegates to the
  inner DataFrame (un-accelerated fallback).
- **AutoML `create_estimator`**: Now instantiates real `SupervisedAdapter<M>` wrappers
  for LinearRegression, DecisionTree, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting. The new
  `SupervisedAdapter` bridges `SupervisedModel` to the `SklearnPredictor` interface.
- **`RandomizedSearchCV::fit`**: Implemented real k-fold cross-validation (was a
  `best_score_: 0.8` placeholder). Reports genuine `best_params_`, `best_score_`,
  `std_test_score`, and `cv_results_`.
- **`examples/scirs2_integration_example.rs`**: New example demonstrating correlation,
  statistical tests, PCA, and linear algebra via the `SciRS2Ext` trait.
- **Descriptive statistics — variance, std dev, quantile, ANOVA by group**:
  `stats::descriptive` gains `variance(data, ddof)`, `std_dev(data, ddof)`,
  `quantile(data, q)` (linear-interpolation, NumPy-compatible), and
  `anova_by_group(values, groups)` for one-way ANOVA F-statistic computation.
  All are available without the `scirs2` feature.
- **Expanded Arrow data types support** (`distributed` feature): `ArrowConverter`
  now handles `Int8`, `Int16`, `Int32`, `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, `UInt64`,
  `Float32`, `LargeUtf8`, `Binary`, `Date32`, `Date64`, `Timestamp`,
  `Duration`, `List`, `LargeList`, `FixedSizeList`, `Struct`, and `Dictionary`
  Arrow data types.
- **Parquet read/write in local filesystem connector** (`distributed` feature):
  `LocalConnector` implements Parquet read and write via the local filesystem,
  enabling `read_parquet` / `write_parquet` on `LocalConnector` instances.
- **Flight server dataset handling** (`flight` feature): Updated Flight server
  methods for more robust dataset loading and publishing.

### Fixed

- Fixed `oxiarc-core` version resolution: bumped from `0.2.6` to `0.2.8` in Cargo.lock
  so that `oxiarc-lz4 0.2.8` and `oxiarc-zstd 0.2.8` (pulled transitively via
  `scirs2-core 0.4.4`) compile correctly.
- Removed dead `src/index_impl/` directory (was never declared as a module; code was
  unreachable).
- Deleted dead `IndexedRandom` imports from `ml/clustering/mod.rs` and `stats/gpu.rs`
  (trait is not re-exported by `scirs2_core::random`; imports were unused).
- Fixed metric locking deadlock/race in real-time analytics and streaming:
  `src/arrow_integration.rs`, `src/distributed/core/dataframe.rs`, and
  `src/distributed/engines/datafusion/mod.rs` now acquire metric locks correctly.
  Associated streaming test (`tests/streaming_test.rs`) updated accordingly.

### Changed

- `scirs2` feature definition no longer enables `dep:scirs2-core` (it is always-on)
  or `dep:ndarray` (ndarray is now accessed via `scirs2_core::ndarray`).
- `cuda` feature no longer enables `dep:ndarray` (same reason).
- Updated SciRS2 dependencies to version 0.4.4 (from 0.4.3).
- `oxiarc-archive` updated to 0.3.2.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Converted the root `Cargo.toml` into a Cargo virtual workspace and hoisted the
  common dependency set (~55 entries) into `[workspace.dependencies]`, so
  subcrates inherit consistent versions via `*.workspace = true`.
- `py_bindings` subcrate now inherits `version`, `authors`, `edition`,
  `license`, and related metadata from the workspace root.
- Documented the Pure Rust feature pins for `datafusion`, `arrow`, and
  `parquet` (`flate2-zlib-rs` backend) inline where they are declared.

### Fixed

- Resolved `clippy::assertions_on_constants` violations in
  `tests/distributed_*.rs`, `src/stats/gpu.rs`, and
  `src/stats/sampling/mod.rs`.
- Replaced hardcoded `/tmp/` paths in the plugin and cloud-storage integration
  tests with `std::env::temp_dir()` so tests are portable across platforms.
- Weakened the assertion in `stats::sampling::test_simple_sample` to reflect
  the true invariant: `sample_impl` never adds columns (a known pre-existing
  limitation that the test had been asserting against incorrectly).
- Excluded `ParquetCompression::Zstd` from `test_parquet_compression_options`,
  since Zstd is intentionally disabled under the Pure Rust build.

### Removed

- Dropped the unused `sql` feature from `py_bindings/Cargo.toml` — the feature
  never existed on the parent `pandrs` crate and only produced a warning.
- Purged 134 stale `*.backup2` / `*.rs.backup2` files from the tree and added
  matching patterns to `.gitignore` to prevent reintroduction.

### Notes

- 1813 tests pass (up from 1809 in 0.3.1). No public API changes.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-19

### Changed

#### Pure Rust Policy — Excel/xlsx (in-tree, OxiARC-backed)

- Replaced `simple_excel_writer` + `calamine` with an in-tree xlsx reader/writer built on `oxiarc-archive` (Pure Rust ZIP) and `quick-xml`. The `excel` feature no longer pulls `zip`, `flate2`, or `miniz_oxide`. Public xlsx API is fully preserved; advanced features (formulas/formatting/named-ranges) behave the same as they did under the previous path, with formula/named-range tracking deferred to a follow-up.
- New internal module `src/io/xlsx/` containing:
  - `reader.rs` — OxiARC + quick-xml based xlsx reader
  - `writer.rs` — OxiARC + quick-xml based xlsx writer
  - `cell.rs` — cell value / coordinate helpers
  - `schema.rs` — workbook / sheet schema types
  - `error.rs` — xlsx-local error type
  - `mod.rs` — module surface
- `src/io/excel.rs` is now a thin public facade that preserves all existing public types (`ExcelCell`, `ExcelCellFormat`, `NamedRange`, ...) and function signatures; it forwards to `crate::io::xlsx` internally.
- New round-trip integration test: `tests/excel_roundtrip_test.rs`.
- Added `oxiarc-archive = "0.2.6"` and `quick-xml = "0.39.2"` as optional deps under the `excel` feature; removed `calamine` and `simple_excel_writer` from the dependency tree.

#### Pure Rust Policy — `-sys` crate cleanup

- Replaced the `dirs` crate with an inline `std::env`-based `user_config_dir()` in `src/config/loader.rs`. Resolution follows XDG / macOS / Windows conventions and returns `Option<PathBuf>` with identical semantics. Removes `dirs` and its `dirs-sys` transitive from the default build; `cargo build --no-default-features` now has zero `-sys` crates outside the OS-API acceptable set (only `core-foundation-sys` via `iana-time-zone`/`chrono` for macOS timezone lookup remains, which is unavoidable OS FFI).
- Pinned `datafusion 53.1.0` to `default-features = false` with an explicit feature list that drops `compression`. Eliminates `liblzma-sys` (C libxz) completely from `--features distributed`, `--features flight`, `--features serving`, and `--all-features`, and also drops the `bzip2` / `async-compression` chain those defaults pulled in. User-visible DataFusion APIs are unchanged.
- Pinned `parquet 58.1.0` to `default-features = false` with `[arrow, snap, brotli, flate2-zlib-rs, lz4, base64, simdutf8]`. The `flate2-zlib-rs` backend selects the Pure Rust `zlib-rs` implementation (not `miniz_oxide`). Eliminates `zstd-sys` from `--features stable`.
- Pinned `arrow 58.1.0` to `default-features = false` with `[csv, ipc, json]` (the existing upstream default) to lock down against future default-set drift that could re-introduce `ipc_compression` → `zstd-sys` / `lz4-sys`.

#### Dependency bumps

- `scirs2-core`, `scirs2-stats`, `scirs2-linalg`: `0.4.0` → `0.4.2`
- `datafusion`: `53.0.0` → `53.1.0` (pinned `default-features = false`; see Pure Rust section above)
- `tokio`: `1.50` → `1.52` (both primary and dev-dependency)
- `rayon`: `1.11.0` → `1.12.0`
- `rand`: `0.10.0` → `0.10.1`
- `cranelift` / `cranelift-module` / `cranelift-jit` / `cranelift-frontend` / `cranelift-native`: `0.130.0` → `0.130.1`
- `uuid`: `1.23.0` → `1.23.1`
- `lru`: `0.16.3` → `0.17.0`
- `toml`: `1.1.0` → `1.1.2`
- `wasm-bindgen`: `0.2.114` → `0.2.118`
- `js-sys`: `0.3.91` → `0.3.95`
- `web-sys`: `0.3.91` → `0.3.95`

### Fixed

- Pinned `sha2 = "0.10"` (was `sha2 = "0.10.8"`) so Cargo can resolve a `digest 0.10.x`-compatible version shared with `pbkdf2` / `aes-gcm`. Fixes a build error triggered when `sha2 0.10.9` shifted its `digest` contract.
- Intra-doc link fix in `src/io/excel.rs` (referenced a private module); rustdoc now builds cleanly with `-D warnings`.
- Refactored Excel I/O error handling and formatting for readability (no behaviour change).

### Regressions (intentional, Pure Rust policy)

- Zstd-compressed parquet files are no longer readable on `--features stable` / `--features parquet`. Snappy (the pandas default), gzip, brotli, and lz4 compressed parquet continue to work. Users needing zstd on pure `stable` must pre-decompress or enable a future opt-in C feature (not currently provided).
- DataFusion's built-in xz / bz2 / zstd auto-decompression for CSV and JSON readers on `--features distributed` / `--features flight` / `--features serving` is disabled. Plain and gzip-compressed inputs still work via DataFusion's default readers; for other compressions, decompress upstream.

### Known tech debt (acknowledged, feature-gated)

- `parquet` / `distributed` / `flight` features still transitively pull `flate2`, `lz4_flex`, `snap`, `brotli`, `miniz_oxide` via upstream `arrow` / `parquet` / `datafusion`. Default `cargo build` pulls none of these.
- `--features distributed` / `--features flight` still transitively pull `zstd-sys` and `miniz_oxide` because `datafusion 53.1.0`'s own `Cargo.toml` hardcodes `default-features = true` on the `parquet` crate (see `datafusion-53.1.0/Cargo.toml [dependencies.parquet]`). Cargo features are additive across a dep graph, so our `default-features = false` on pandrs's direct `parquet` dep cannot suppress the `zstd` feature that datafusion requests. `--features stable` is unaffected. Removing this fully requires upstream work in DataFusion.
- `cloud-storage` feature pulls `ring` (C + assembly) via `object_store 0.13.2`. Upstream blocker: object_store uses `ring::{hmac, digest, signature, rand}` directly and exposes `ring::error` types in its public API, so neither `rustls-rustcrypto` nor feature toggles can eliminate it. Default build is unaffected.

### Testing & Quality

- **1809 tests passing** (nextest, `--all-features`) and **117 doc tests passing**
- Zero clippy warnings with `-D warnings`
- Rustdoc builds cleanly with `-D warnings`

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Breaking Changes

- Removed all SQL/database dependencies (sqlx, rusqlite, libsqlite3-sys) to enforce Pure Rust policy
  - Removed sql module (src/io/sql/), sql_backup.rs, database connector
  - Removed SqlOps, SqlConnection traits
  - Removed sql feature flag
  - Removed database examples and tests

### Changed

- Upgraded datafusion 52.2 to 53.0
- Upgraded cranelift 0.129 to 0.130
- Upgraded tokio 1.48 to 1.50

- Added global debug info reduction (.cargo/config.toml) for build size optimization

### Fixed
