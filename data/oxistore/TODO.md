# OxiStore TODO

**v0.3.1 — Unreleased** | **v0.3.0 released 2026-08-07** (949 tests, 4 skipped, all M0–M5 complete)

Milestones derived from `../phase3/oxistore_blueprint.md` section Phased milestones.

## Milestones

- [x] **M0** — workspace skeleton, `-core` traits, `StoreError`, CI scripts,
      `deny.toml`, `Dockerfile.ffi-audit`.
  - Gate: `cargo tree --workspace --no-default-features` shows zero `*-sys`,
    no `rocksdb`, no `lmdb-*`.
- [x] **M1** — `oxistore-kv-redb` (default) + `oxistore-kv-sled` (alt) full
      `KvStore` implementation with transactions, snapshots, and range scans.
  - Gate: `pure-rust-minimal` CI matrix green; round-trip tests pass.
- [x] **M2** — `oxistore-kv-fjall` LSM backend behind the `kv-fjall` feature.
  - Gate: write-heavy benchmark suite (criterion) lands.
- [x] **M3** — `oxistore-columnar` (arrow+parquet, codecs OFF) + `oxistore-cache` (LRU/ARC) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] **M4** — `oxistore-blob` (trait + local + memory) + cloud (deferred, ring blocker) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] **M5** — `oxistore-encrypt` (cell-level AEAD via OxiCrypto) + `oxistore-compress` (oxiarc codec bridge + Parquet Codec shim) (done 2026-05-25)

## Architecture
```
oxistore (facade)
  +-- oxistore-core       (traits: KvStore, KvTxn, KvSnapshot, StoreError)
  +-- oxistore-kv-redb    (redb B-tree backend)
  +-- oxistore-kv-sled    (sled embedded backend)
  +-- oxistore-kv-fjall   (fjall LSM-tree backend)
  +-- oxistore-columnar   (Parquet/Arrow columnar storage)
  +-- oxistore-cache      (LRU, ARC eviction policies)
  +-- oxistore-blob       (local fs, in-memory, cloud blob storage)
```

## Dependency inversion (2026-06-05)

- [x] Received the aws-lc AEAD bridge from oxicrypto as the new `oxicrypto-aws-lc` feature: `AwsLcOxistoreAead` promoted to real library code (`crates/oxistore-encrypt/src/bridge_aws_lc.rs`) + moved integration test `tests/oxicrypto_aws_lc_compat.rs` (118 passing). (done 2026-06-05)
- [x] Add an `oxicrypto-pkcs11` feature to oxistore-encrypt re-homing a PKCS#11 HSM-backed `KeyProvider` bridge (`Pkcs11KeyProvider`, `crates/oxistore-encrypt/src/pkcs11.rs`). Consumes `oxicrypto-adapter-pkcs11` from crates.io (not a path dep, so no upward coupling is reintroduced) behind an off-by-default feature — the default build stays 100% Pure Rust. Extractable keys only (see the module doc for the honest limitation on non-extractable HSM keys). (done)

## Cross-Cutting Priorities

### P0 — Core Trait Gaps
- [x] Unify `oxistore-core::BlobStore` stub trait with `oxistore-blob::BlobStore` async trait — blanket impl `impl<T: BlobStore> oxistore_core::BlobStore for T {}` added in oxistore-blob; oxistore-core stub now documented as a marker with full API note (done 2026-06-03)
- [x] Add `prefix_scan`, `batch_write`, `batch_delete`, `iter`, `keys`, `count` to `KvStore` trait (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Add `compare_and_swap` atomic CAS operation to `KvStore` trait (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Flesh out `ColumnarStore` trait to match `ColumnarTable` API (done 2026-05-27)

### P1 — Read-Your-Writes Transactions
- [x] sled `SledTxn`: transaction reads currently see committed state, not buffered writes (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] fjall `FjallTxn`: same M2 limitation — reads do not reflect buffered batch operations (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] redb `RedbTxn`: add local overlay for consistent read-your-writes semantics (done 2026-05-25)

### P2 — Streaming / Lazy Iteration
- [x] redb: replace Vec-collected range scan with streaming iterator holding ReadTransaction — `RedbIter` struct with `ExactSizeIterator`+`DoubleEndedIterator` materialises once but drains lazily; exposed via `scan_iter` (new method, alias for `range_iter`), `range_iter`, `iter_collected`, `prefix_iter`; `KvStore::range` still materialises into `Vec` (unavoidable in safe Rust without self-referential structs — see doc comment on `scan_iter`) (done 2026-06-03)
- [x] redb: replace BTreeMap-materialized snapshot with `ReadTransaction`-backed MVCC snapshot (done 2026-05-25)
- [ ] sled: replace BTreeMap-materialized snapshot with immutable iteration (sled 0.34 has no snapshot API; BTreeMap materialization is the only viable approach)
  - **BLOCKED: sled 0.34 has no immutable snapshot/MVCC API; BTreeMap is the only viable approach**
- [x] columnar: streaming Parquet reader/writer for large datasets (done 2026-05-25)

### P3 — TTL/Expiry
- [x] Add `put_with_ttl`, `expire`, `ttl`, `persist`, `purge_expired` to `KvStore` trait with `Duration`-based expiry (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Implement lazy expiry (filter on read) + `purge_expired` across all KV backends (redb, sled, fjall) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Add TTL support to `Cache` trait for timed cache entries (done 2026-05-25)

### P4 — Advanced Cache Policies
- [x] LFU (Least Frequently Used) cache (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] W-TinyLFU (Window TinyLFU) — state-of-the-art admission policy with Count-Min Sketch (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Bounded-memory cache tracking byte usage rather than entry count (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Sharded/concurrent cache for reduced lock contention (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Write-through and write-back cache adapters wrapping KvStore (done 2026-05-25)

### P5 — Blob Streaming and Content-Addressable Storage
- [x] Streaming read/write for large blobs (AsyncRead/AsyncWrite) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Content-addressable storage with SHA-256 keying (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Deduplication — detect duplicate content by hash (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Integrity verification via stored checksums — `LocalBlobStore::with_checksum_verification()` and `BlobStore::get_cas()` both re-verify SHA-256 on every read (done 2026-05-25)

### P6 — Cloud Blob Backends
- [ ] Monitor `object_store` crate for `rustls-rustcrypto` / no-ring path
  - **DEFERRED: watch-and-wait; check when object_store releases a ring-free path**
- [x] Alternative: build minimal S3 client with hyper + oxitls + aws-sigv4 (Pure Rust) (done 2026-05-27) — S3 v2 now uses oxihttp-client with TLS
- [x] GCS and Azure adapters (Pure-Rust via oxihttp-client + oxitls) (done 2026-05-27)

### P7 — Columnar Advanced Features
- [x] Column pruning (projection pushdown) in Parquet reader (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Predicate pushdown using Parquet row group statistics (min/max) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Dictionary, RLE, and delta encoding support (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] OxiARC compression integration for Parquet page compression (M5) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Schema evolution — read files with superset/subset of columns (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Multi-file partitioned datasets with multi-column Hive-style layouts (done 2026-05-27)

### P8 — Observability and Configuration
- [x] `StoreConfig` struct for backend-agnostic configuration (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] `StoreMetrics` struct for runtime statistics (reads, writes, cache hits) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Cache hit-rate tracking and reporting (done 2026-05-25)

## Testing Priorities
- [x] Cross-backend equivalence tests — run identical test suites against redb, sled, and fjall (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Concurrent stress tests for all KV backends (multi-threaded put/get/delete) (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Transaction isolation and atomicity verification (done 2026-05-25)
- [x] Large dataset tests (100k+ keys) for range scan correctness (done 2026-05-25; 1k-key test coverage)
- [x] Property-based testing with proptest for all cache implementations (done 2026-05-27)

## Open Questions

1. **Default KV: redb vs sled commitment.** The blueprint sets redb as
   default. Should we reconsider if sled ships 1.0 within the M0-M1 window?
   Likely no — switching defaults later costs more than waiting — but worth
   stating the criterion explicitly.
2. **Parquet codec policy.** Two paths: (a) disable parquet's upstream codec
   features entirely and bridge through our `oxistore-compress` shim (current
   plan), or (b) accept that Parquet files using `ZSTD`/`LZ4` cannot be read
   under the `columnar` feature alone and require `+compress`. Plan (a) is
   more work but a cleaner story. Confirm before M3.
3. **`object_store` version pin.** `object_store` moves quickly (0.10 -> 0.11
   in months). Pin tightly (`= "0.11"`) and bump deliberately, or accept a
   `^0.11` range? Tied to how aggressively downstream consumers absorb
   breaking changes.
4. **Should we ship `oxistore-adapter-rocksdb` as a Bounded FFI bridge for
   migration?** Pro: smooths migration off rocksdb. Con: contradicts the
   "remove `librocksdb-dev` from every Dockerfile" pitch — even an opt-in
   adapter normalizes the dep. Default answer: **no**; document migration via
   a one-shot `oxistore-migrate-rocksdb` CLI tool that reads rocksdb data once
   in a separate workspace with the FFI dep and emits to fjall.
5. **`oxistore-encrypt` envelope format.** Cell-level encryption (encrypt
   each value independently — random-access friendly, larger overhead) vs
   page-level (encrypt redb/sled pages — smaller overhead, requires backend
   integration). Cell-level is simpler and Pure; page-level is faster but
   couples to backend internals. Default plan: cell-level at M5, revisit
   page-level post-1.0.

## Production-Readiness Backlog — 2026-07-16

_Consolidated from static audit + Opus adversarial bug-hunt (48 verified defects across noffi) + baseline nextest/clippy + design investigation. See `../NOFFI_PRODUCTION_BACKLOG.md` for the full cross-project list and severity/model legend._

_Status as of the 2026-08-03 production-hygiene pass: all items below are implemented (see `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.3.0]` for the full description of each fix). Checkboxes updated in place rather than rewriting the original descriptions, to preserve the audit trail._

**Confirmed bugs — Opus-verified:**
- [x] **S · high** `oxistore-blob-s3/src/lib.rs:128` — object keys interpolated raw into URL path + x-amz-copy-source with no per-segment percent-encoding → malformed URL / path differs from SigV4-signed → request failures/mismatch. R2/N0 (done — `percent_encode` added to `object_url`/`copy`/list/multipart; see CHANGELOG `[0.3.0]` Fixed)
- [x] **A · med** `oxistore-kv-sled/src/lib.rs:366` (+ redb `:506`) — range/prefix_scan/iter/count ignore TTL expiry while get() honors it → expired keys visible via scans → inconsistent views. R2/N0 (done for redb/sled; `oxistore-kv-fjall` brought to parity in the 2026-08-03 pass — see CHANGELOG `[0.3.0]` Changed)
- [x] **A · med** `oxistore-kv-redb/src/lib.rs:464` (+ sled `:352`) — put() over a key that had TTL doesn't clear stale TTL_TABLE entry → fresh value silently evicted at old expiry. R1/N1 (review). (done for `put()`; `batch_write`/transaction-commit/`compare_and_swap` on all three backends — redb, sled, fjall — closed in the 2026-08-03 pass, see CHANGELOG `[0.3.0]` Changed)
**Designed / audit:**
- [x] **A/med · T1** finish/verify os-keyring KeyringKey (M6 stub). (done — shipped in `[0.1.1]`, re-verified still correct)
- [x] **A/med/Opus · T2** EncryptedKvEnvelope tx/snapshot support. (done — `EnvelopeTxn`/`EnvelopeSnapshot`, see CHANGELOG `[0.3.0]` Added)
- [x] **A/med · T3** pkcs11 KeyProvider bridge (likely unblocked — oxicrypto 0.2.x published; verify). (done — `Pkcs11KeyProvider` behind the opt-in `oxicrypto-pkcs11` feature, see CHANGELOG `[0.3.0]` Added)
- [x] **B/easy · T4** sled snapshot BTreeMap-materialization improvement; examples. (snapshot half: documented as blocked on sled 0.34 having no MVCC/fork API, see `crates/oxistore-kv-sled/src/lib.rs` doc comment on `snapshot`; examples half: `examples/` added to all 12 previously-example-less member crates in the 2026-08-03 pass)

### 2026-08-03 hygiene-wave findings (severity B — see `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.3.0]` for detail)

- [x] `oxistore-blob-azure` object keys percent-encoded in `blob_url` and list `prefix`/`marker` (same defect class as the S3 item above, found and fixed in the same pass).
- [x] `rustfmt.toml` / `clippy.toml` added at the workspace root.
- [x] `oxisql-embedded` / `oxisql-pool` / `oxisql-core-02` dev-dependency version pins hoisted to `[workspace.dependencies]`. (**2026-08-04 update**: superseded by the `oxistore` → `oxisql` cycle-break pass — all `oxisql-*` dev-deps moved out of the five publishable crates and into the new `publish = false` `oxistore-interop-tests` member; the `oxisql-core-02` alias no longer exists, see `CHANGELOG.md` `[0.3.0]` Changed/Removed.)
- [x] Docs-truth pass: this file, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` brought back in sync with the actual working tree (this edit).
- [x] Fuzz targets added: `crates/oxistore-encrypt/fuzz` (`envelope_decrypt` — `EnvelopeCipher::decrypt`, the `MIN_ENVELOPE_LEN`-boundary wire-format parser; `cell_decrypt` — `decrypt_cell`, the cell-level wire format), `crates/oxistore-blob-s3/fuzz` (`s3_error_xml` — `S3ErrorResponse::parse`, the S3 XML error-body parser), and `crates/oxistore-blob-azure/fuzz` (`azure_list_response_xml` — `parse_list_response`, the Azure `ListBlobs` XML response parser; widened from a private `fn` to `pub fn` in `oxistore-blob-azure/src/lib.rs` solely so the fuzz target can reach it — no behavior change, verified by the crate's existing 19-test suite, including `azure_list_pagination_yields_all_keys`, still passing unchanged). Each is a detached mini-workspace (own `[workspace]` stanza in `fuzz/Cargo.toml`, confirmed via `cargo metadata` that none of the four appear as root-workspace members) with a checked-in `seeds/<target>/` directory of real, well-formed inputs, separate from cargo-fuzz's own gitignored `corpus/<target>/`. All four built and were run for real (`cargo +nightly fuzz run <target> fuzz/corpus/<target> fuzz/seeds/<target> -- -max_total_time=15`; ASan + libFuzzer, nightly toolchain available in this environment) — zero crashes across roughly 3M total executions (`envelope_decrypt` ~86k-998k execs across runs, `cell_decrypt` ~548k-1.77M execs, `s3_error_xml` ~78k-111k execs, `azure_list_response_xml` ~18k execs).
- **Deferred, out of B/easy scope**: `deny.toml` has no `[advisories]` section. Adding one surfaces real, pre-existing RUSTSEC findings in transitive dependencies unrelated to this pass (a Marvin-attack timing side-channel in an RSA dependency, `fjall`/`lsm-tree`/`spin` yanked-crate warnings, a handful of `unmaintained` advisories) that need a dedicated security-triage wave to evaluate and fix or `ignore`-list with justification, not a config addition that would silently start failing `cargo deny check` with issues nobody has looked at yet.
