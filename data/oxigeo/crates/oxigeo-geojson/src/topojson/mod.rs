//! TopoJSON 3.0 encoder for the `oxigeo-geojson-stream` crate.
//!
//! Converts a [`FeatureCollection`](crate::parser::FeatureCollection) to a
//! quantised, arc-deduplicated Topology JSON string following the
//! [TopoJSON specification](https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification).
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//!
//! 1. Compute the bounding box of all features to build a quantisation transform.
//! 2. Walk all polygon rings *and* line chains (LineString / MultiLineString),
//!    quantising coordinates to integer grid positions.
//! 3. Normalise rings (remove duplicate closing vertex); keep open chains verbatim.
//! 4. Detect *junctions* — vertices where two or more arcs meet with different
//!    neighbours, ring start vertices, and line chain endpoints.
//! 5. Cut rings (cyclically) and chains (linearly) into arcs at junctions;
//!    deduplicate using a canonical (lexicographically smallest) arc key shared
//!    across rings and chains so a common sub-path is stored once.
//! 6. Delta-encode arcs for compact wire representation.
//! 7. Serialise as a `{"type":"Topology",...}` JSON object.
//!
//! ## Arc reversal
//!
//! Reverse arc index `i` is encoded as `!(i as i32)` per TopoJSON spec §2.1.4
//! — bitwise NOT, not negation.
