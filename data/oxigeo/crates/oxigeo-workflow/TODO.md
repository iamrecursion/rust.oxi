# TODO: oxigeo-workflow

> **Purpose:** DAG-based workflow engine — orchestrates geospatial processing pipelines with cycle detection, retries, timeouts, scheduling.
> **Status (2026-07-28):** 22,405 LoC · 213 tests · 1 real-code stub remains (Airflow import) — scheduler persistence, external HMAC, and Prefect/Temporal import (round-trip of this crate's own generated format) from the prior audit are now implemented.
> **Roadmap:** v0.1.7 → v0.2.0 → v1.0.0

## High Priority (verified gaps)
- [x] Implement scheduler state persistence (save/load to disk)
  - Done: 2026-05-31 (Slice 28). Tests: 9 new (scheduler_persist_test) + 150 existing = 159 total.
  - **Verified gap:** `src/scheduler/mod.rs:413-417` — `if let Some(_path) = &self.config.persistence_path { /* Persistence implementation would go here */ /* For now, this is a placeholder */ }`. Same pattern at `:422-428` for `load_state`.
  - **Goal:** Persist `Schedule` collection + `execution_history` to JSON file under `persistence_path`; on `Scheduler::start()`, reload pending/in-flight schedules so crash-recovery resumes within the next tick.
  - **Design:** `persist_state` serializes `DashMap<ScheduleId, Schedule>` snapshot via `tokio::fs::write` with `<path>.tmp` rename (atomic). Format: JSON-Lines, one `Schedule` per line for incremental updates. `load_state` reads file, repopulates map. Trigger save on `add_schedule`/`remove_schedule`/`record_execution` (debounced via `tokio::time::interval` to reduce write amplification).
  - **Files:** `src/scheduler/mod.rs:412-428` (replace stub bodies), add `persist_interval: Duration` to `SchedulerConfig`.
  - **Tests:** *(proposed)* `test_scheduler_persists_on_add`, `test_scheduler_load_state_restores_schedules`, `test_scheduler_atomic_rename`, `test_scheduler_corrupt_file_returns_error`, `test_scheduler_missing_file_starts_empty`.
  - **Risk:** Race between in-flight `update_execution_status` and snapshot read — take a clone-snapshot under lock before flushing.
  - **Prerequisites:** None.

- [x] Replace HMAC-SHA256 placeholder in external WebhookTrigger with real crypto
  - Done: 2026-05-31 (Slice 29). Tests: 9 new (webhook_hmac_test) + 174 existing = 183 total.
  - Real `hmac::Hmac<Sha256>` (RustCrypto 0.13/0.11). `hex_encode` → `hmac_sha256_hex`; uppercase normalization; RFC 4231 KAT pinned. Also fixed orphaned `pub mod external;` in `integrations/mod.rs`.

- [ ] Implement workflow import for Airflow (Prefect + Temporal done)
  - **Partially done 2026-07-21 (0.2.1 production campaign):** `PrefectIntegration::import_workflow` and `TemporalIntegration::import_workflow` are now real. Both round-trip this crate's own `export_workflow` output: they check for a `GENERATED_MARKER` header comment + the `workflow_id`/`workflow_name` (Temporal) metadata comments + per-task decorator/function markers (`@task(name='task_{N}')` / `func Task{N}Activity`) via regex, then rebuild a sequential `WorkflowDefinition` (`task-0 -> task-1 -> ...`). Arbitrary hand-written Prefect/Temporal source is explicitly rejected with a descriptive `WorkflowError::Integration` rather than silently misparsed — this is a documented round-trip contract, not a general Python/Go parser. The `temporal.rs:27` `// TODO: Implement activity logic` placeholder is also gone: exported Go now emits a real `exec.Command(...)` body when a task has a `command` (see `TaskNode::command`), else an honest "no command configured, original config: {...}" placeholder body (mirrors the same pattern in `airflow.rs`/`prefect.rs` export).
  - **Remaining gap:** `src/integrations/airflow.rs` `import_workflow` is still `Err(WorkflowError::integration("airflow", "Import from Airflow not yet implemented"))` — only Airflow import remains unimplemented.
  - **Goal:** `AirflowIntegration::import_workflow` parses Airflow-dialect input and constructs an equivalent `WorkflowDefinition`, either via the same self-export round-trip scoping used for Prefect/Temporal (simplest, consistent) or the JSON-contract approach originally sketched below.
  - **Design (original JSON-contract sketch, still applicable):** Accept Airflow's JSON serialization (`airflow dags show --output json`); parse JSON → walk task/dep tree → emit `TaskNode` + `add_dependency`. Document the JSON contract.
  - **Files:** `src/integrations/airflow.rs` (replace stub only — `prefect.rs`/`temporal.rs` already done).
  - **Tests:** *(proposed)* `test_airflow_import_round_trips_own_export` (if self-export scoping is chosen) or `test_airflow_import_simple_dag_json` + `test_airflow_import_malformed_json_errors` (if JSON-contract scoping is chosen).
  - **Risk:** Python-side AST → JSON converters are not stable across Airflow versions; document tested versions in rustdoc and pin one schema.
  - **Prerequisites:** None.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Persistent execution history backed by SQLite (or oxiarc-archive batched JSON)
  - **Goal:** Survive process restarts with full audit trail; current `ExecutionHistory` is in-memory.
  - **Files:** `src/monitoring/tracker/types.rs` (1520 LoC, refactor candidate per <2000 LoC policy), `src/engine/state.rs` (756 LoC).
  - **Why deferred:** In-memory + serializable today; persistent layer requires schema design.

- [ ] Resource limits per task (memory, CPU, disk I/O)
  - **Goal:** `ResourceRequirements` (already at `src/dag/graph.rs:58-69`) is recorded but not enforced; cgroups (Linux) or rlimits required for real enforcement.
  - **Files:** `src/engine/executor.rs` (843 LoC).
  - **Why deferred:** Pure Rust portable enforcement is hard; document declarative-only for now.

- [ ] Dynamic DAG modification at runtime (add/remove tasks mid-execution)
  - **Goal:** Mutate running DAG while preserving consistency (e.g., add tasks downstream of an active node).
  - **Files:** `src/dag/graph.rs` (1136 LoC), `src/engine/runtime.rs` (325 LoC).
  - **Why deferred:** Most workflows are static; complex invariant preservation deferred.

- [ ] Sub-workflow (nested DAG) execution
  - **Goal:** `TaskNode` with `config` referencing another `WorkflowDefinition`; engine recurses.
  - **Files:** `src/engine/executor.rs`.
  - **Why deferred:** Requires shared `TaskExecutor` registry — design open.

- [ ] Webhook trigger end-to-end (axum/server feature already gated)
  - **Goal:** HTTP server accepting webhooks, validating HMAC signature, instantiating workflow.
  - **Files:** `src/integrations/external.rs` (1739 LoC — refactor candidate per <2000 LoC policy).
  - **Why deferred:** Server feature already gated; full wiring needs HMAC fix above first.

- [ ] Map/reduce pattern operator for parallel batch processing
  - **Goal:** Fan-out N parallel tasks, fan-in collector task; declarative.
  - **Files:** `src/dag/parallelism.rs` (354 LoC).
  - **Why deferred:** Manual DAG construction supports this today; sugar deferred.

## Low Priority / Future (one-liners)
- [ ] Workflow marketplace/registry for sharing reusable pipelines
- [ ] A/B testing workflow variants with metric comparison
- [ ] Cloud cost estimation (AWS/GCP pricing per task type)
- [ ] Workflow diff/versioning with semantic change detection (`src/versioning/diff.rs` exists, 791 LoC)
- [ ] Kubernetes Job/CronJob manifest generation from `WorkflowDefinition`
- [ ] Data lineage tracking across workflow executions (oxigeo-security lineage integration)
- [ ] SLA monitoring with deadline-based alerting
- [ ] Cost estimation for cloud-executed workflows (AWS/GCP pricing)
