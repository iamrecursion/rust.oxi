//! Node-to-node transport for cluster consensus RPCs.
//!
//! Leader election in [`crate::coordinator`] must contact real peers rather than
//! fabricate votes from a node's local view of the cluster. This module defines
//! the minimal RPC surface for that — a [`VoteRequest`]/[`VoteResponse`] pair and
//! the [`NodeTransport`] trait a deployment plugs a real network implementation
//! (for example a `tonic` gRPC client) into.
//!
//! A default [`UnconfiguredTransport`] is provided so a coordinator built without
//! an explicit transport is *safe by construction*: it can never reach a peer, so
//! it can never gather a fabricated quorum. A single-node cluster still elects
//! itself through its own self-vote, but a multi-node cluster with no wired
//! transport correctly fails to elect a leader instead of silently splitting.
