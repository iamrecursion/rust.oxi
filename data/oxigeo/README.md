> **Note:** **OxiGeo** is the new name of **OxiGDAL**. v0.1.7 was the final release under the OxiGDAL name; development continues as OxiGeo from v0.2.0 with an otherwise identical codebase. This project is an independent reimplementation and is not affiliated with the GDAL project.

[![OxiGeo GeoSentinel — Sentinel-2 before/after animation of the 28 July 2026 M7.1 Kumamoto earthquake, showing a new 52 ha bare-ground scar on the south-east flank of Mt Mayuyama above Shimabara](docs/media/kumamoto-mayuyama.gif)](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)

<sub>**Mj7.1 Kumamoto earthquake, 28 July 2026, 16:27 JST.** Five consecutive Sentinel-2 L2A passes over Mt Mayuyama, above Shimabara, at 10 m: unbroken forest a year earlier, cloud over the site on every pass in the fortnight before the quake, then the slope reappearing the next morning already scarred, and clearing completely six days later. Change detection against the 2025 scene — same season, so vegetation phenology cancels — at NDVI drop ≥ 0.15 and a 0.5 ha minimum patch finds **168.8 ha across 85 patches** over the full preset area of interest, the largest being this **52 ha bare-ground scar**; the animation is a crop holding 114 ha of that. What the pictures can and cannot say: the scar is absent on 2025-07-29 and present ~19 hours after the earthquake, but every 2026 pre-event pass was overcast over the site (2.5%, 12.1% and 0.0% clear on 07-14, 07-21 and 07-24), so imagery alone dates the failure only to that 12-month interval. Note too where this method does *not* look — the epicentral damage in Kumamoto Prefecture itself, collapsed buildings, bridge failures, liquefaction and fires, leaves no NDVI signature at all. Every step, from the STAC search to the polygon areas, runs in the browser in Pure-Rust WebAssembly, and it is the first preset in the live demo. **[Run it yourself](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)**</sub>

[![OxiGeo GeoSentinel — Sentinel-2 before/after animation of the 26 August 2026 Rasuwa ice-rock avalanche flood, showing a 128 ha scour ribbon stripped along the Trishuli valley floor at Betrawati in Nuwakot, Nepal, running the full height of the 4.2 × 7.2 km frame](docs/media/rasuwa-trishuli.gif)](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)

<sub>**Rasuwa ice-rock avalanche flood, 26 August 2026, ~08:37 NPT.** Ice and rock fell from the Lhende Khola headwaters in Tibet; the surge ran down the Bhote Koshi into the Trishuli. Five of the nine Sentinel-2 L2A passes over this view between 28 July and 27 August, at 10 m, the last carrying the detection: a braided river under monsoon cloud, a spotless valley floor on 08-12, blank overcast on 08-22, 93% cloud on 08-24 — the three passes in between were 93–100% clouded over this view — then, 26 hours after the collapse, a pale scoured strip several times the old channel width at Betrawati, ~40 km downstream. Change detection against 08-12 — same season, so phenology cancels, and the 8 July 2025 Rasuwagadhi GLOF sits in both scenes, cancelling too — at NDVI drop ≥ 0.15 and a 0.5 ha minimum finds **20 patches / 273.7 ha** over the preset area, **206.9 ha** of it channel scour after a clear-sky and distance-to-channel sort, the largest an **87 ha ribbon 5.1 km long**; the rest is cloud, shadow and off-channel farm change the pipeline has no per-pixel mask to drop. The animation's own detection numbers are scoped to its wider crop, not to the preset area — 261.7 ha channel-consistent of 433.5 ha raw, where that ribbon merges with its upstream and downstream neighbours into the single **128 ha strip** the frame calls out; the frame prints the preset AOI's 273.7 / 206.9 ha beside them for comparison. An SCL-only check, no NDVI at all, agrees: ~158 ha newly stripped in fifteen days. Not the headline sites: Rasuwagadhi, Timure and Syabrubesi are half under cloud on the only post-event pass — 44–54% jointly clear against 92% here — where a replay returns cloud blobs, not scars. And what it cannot show: the 32+ bridges, ~40 km of swept Pasang Lhamu Highway, the Timure dry port, 901 MW of affected hydropower and the ~788 dead and ~2,500 missing have no NDVI signature, and imagery alone cannot tell this surge from the ordinary monsoon flooding of a river that floods every August — the size of the fifteen-day change is the argument, not the detection. Every step runs in the browser in Pure-Rust WebAssembly, and it is the second preset in the live demo. **[Run it yourself](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)**</sub>

**GeoSentinel**: watch any place on Earth for change — and tell no one where you're looking. It searches the public Earth Search STAC API for a cloud-filtered Sentinel-2 scene pair, streams only the needed COG windows via HTTP range requests, and runs the whole change-detection pipeline — NDVI difference, thresholding, polygonization, geodesic areas, GeoJSON export — 100% client-side in Pure-Rust WebAssembly; your area of interest never leaves your machine. **[Try it live](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)** — one of **four** hosted [demos](#demos) below, alongside [GeoLab](#geolab--terrain-analysis-on-streamed-cogs), [GeoVault](#geovault--sovereign-clean-room-workstation), and [GeoParquet Live](#geoparquet-live--query-59-gb-with-no-database).

OxiGeo is a comprehensive, production-ready geospatial data abstraction library written in **100% Pure Rust** with zero C/C++/Fortran dependencies in default features. The current release is **v0.2.4** (2026-08-18), a correctness release: the browser COG URL path works end to end (GDAL internal-mask IFDs no longer counted as overview levels, per-level tile geometry, a buffered range-fetch driver), `oxigeo-proj` gains a verified feature matrix (`no_std`/`proj-db`/`proj4rs-compat`), transform results that no longer depend on the `proj-db` feature (on OxiProj 0.1.5), a gated SIMD batch fast path, and a corrected embedded EPSG registry (US State Plane native units, the JGD2011 Japan zones), GeoPackage reads overflow-page cells ([issue #17](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxigeo/issues/17)) and restores REAL affinity in typed scans, GDAL-written VRT mosaics parse and composite correctly ([issue #18](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxigeo/issues/18), [issue #19](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxigeo/issues/19)), and the GeoParquet readers keep null geometries index-aligned. **v0.2.3** (2026-08-05) implemented real Warped VRT support — reading and resampling `<GDALWarpOptions>` VRTs such as `gdalwarp -of VRT` output ([issue #15](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxigeo/issues/15)) — and a public vector-layer API, `Dataset::layers()`/`Layer::features()` for GeoPackage/Shapefile/GeoJSON ([issue #16](https://github.com/cool-japan/oxigeo/issues/16)). It builds on **v0.2.2**'s issue #14 correctness campaign (2026-07-30), **v0.2.1**'s production-hardening pass (2026-07-28), and **v0.2.0**, published to crates.io on 2026-07-20 as the first release under the OxiGeo name — a rename-only release, functionally identical to v0.1.7, which was published the same day as the final release under the OxiGDAL name (v0.1.6 released 2026-06-15). The library delivers ~797K Rust SLoC across **75 workspace crates**, covering 16 geospatial format drivers exposed through `oxigeo::Dataset::open()` (plus separate KML/KMZ and TopoJSON format support in dedicated crates, see [Format Drivers](#architecture)), full CRS transformations, raster/vector algorithms, cloud-native I/O, GPU acceleration, enterprise security, and cross-platform bindings (Python, Node.js, WASM, iOS, Android).

## Demos

Four live, hosted demos — each one runs 100% client-side: Pure-Rust WebAssembly
in your browser tab, no server-side processing, no accounts, no telemetry.

| Demo | One-liner | Live |
|------|-----------|------|
| **GeoLab** | Stream, decode, and terrain-analyze Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs | [cooljapan.tech/geolab](https://cooljapan.tech/geolab/) |
| **GeoSentinel** | Watch any place on Earth for change — and tell no one where you're looking | [cooljapan.tech/geosentinel](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/) |
| **GeoVault** | A clean-room workstation that seals a signed, tamper-evident ledger of everything it did | [cooljapan.tech/geovault](https://cooljapan.tech/geovault/) |

### GeoLab — terrain analysis on streamed COGs

The [GeoLab](https://cooljapan.tech/geolab/) viewer is a Pure-Rust WebAssembly
build of the raster pipeline — GeoTIFF decode, `combined_hillshade`, and colormap
rendering all run in the browser tab, not on a server.

![GeoLab terrain interaction: dragging the sun-azimuth and exaggeration sliders re-renders the San Francisco DEM's hillshade in real time, entirely client-side.](docs/media/geolab-terrain.gif)

Hosted, nothing to install: **[cooljapan.tech/geolab](https://cooljapan.tech/geolab/)**

Or run it locally (builds the WASM module, then serves the static demo):

```sh
cd crates/oxigeo-wasm
wasm-pack build --scope cooljapan --target web --out-dir pkg --release
cd ../../demo/cog-viewer
python3 -m http.server 8080
# open http://localhost:8080
```

#### Native-render gallery

### GeoSentinel — in-browser Sentinel-2 change detection

[![OxiGeo GeoSentinel — Sentinel-2 change detection running entirely in the browser: NDVI-drop polygons over the Lahaina wildfire burn scar](docs/media/geosentinel-hero.png)](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)

**Watch any place on Earth for change — and tell no one where you're looking.**
GeoSentinel searches the public Earth Search STAC API for a cloud-filtered
Sentinel-2 L2A scene pair, streams only the needed COG windows (red + NIR
bands) via HTTP range requests, and runs the whole change-detection pipeline —
NDVI difference, fixed or Otsu thresholding, polygonization, Karney geodesic
areas, GeoJSON export — inside WebAssembly. **[Try it live](https://cooljapan.tech/geosentinel/)**

### GeoVault — sovereign clean-room workstation

[![OxiGeo GeoVault — sovereign analysis workstation with a live tamper-evident session ledger and seal-session attestation](docs/media/geovault-hero.png)](https://cooljapan.tech/geovault/)

**Analyze sensitive terrain data in a browser clean-room that can prove its
session log afterwards.** Every operation is appended to a blake3 hash chain,
rolled up into a Merkle root, and sealed with an Ed25519 signature — producing
a downloadable attestation that an independent verifier page (or a native Rust
example) re-checks from the JSON alone, while a strict Content-Security-Policy
forbids every external connection during the session.

### GeoParquet Live — query 5.9 GB with no database

[![OxiGeo GeoParquet Live — bounding-box and SQL queries against a 5.9 GB remote GeoParquet, pruned to a handful of row groups in the browser](docs/media/geoparquet-hero.png)](https://cooljapan.tech/geoparquet/)

**Query a dataset bigger than your laptop, over the network, with no
database.** The browser points at the VIDA Japan building-footprints
GeoParquet — **5.9 GB, 47.66 million rows, 9,533 row groups** — and answers
bounding-box + attribute queries by downloading only the byte ranges that
survive metadata pruning: the Shinjuku preset prunes 9,533 row groups down to
**7 survivors**, fetches **4.7 MB** of column chunks, and refines the exact
matches in **13 ms**. **[Try it live](https://cooljapan.tech/geoparquet/)**

| VRT | yes | yes | — | — | Band math, mosaic; reads/executes Warped VRTs (`<GDALWarpOptions>`, e.g. `gdalwarp -of VRT` output) |
| GeoPackage | yes | partial | — | — | SQLite-based, vector features + tiles; layers/features via `Dataset::layers()` (needs the non-default `gpkg` feature) — write: point feature tables only, single-page B-tree |
| PMTiles v3 | yes | yes | — | — | Hilbert curve, single-file archive |
| MBTiles | yes | yes | — | — | Tile storage, TMS/XYZ |
| COPC | yes | — | — | — | Cloud Optimized Point Cloud, octree spatial index |

Additional, separately-shipped format support not listed above (not part of
the `oxigeo::Dataset::open()` driver registry, so not counted in the 16):
KML/KMZ read+write (`oxigeo-drivers-advanced`) and a TopoJSON writer
(`oxigeo-geojson` streaming module).

## Usage Examples

### GeoTIFF / COG

```rust
use oxigeo_geotiff::GeoTiffReader;
use oxigeo_core::io::FileDataSource;

let source = FileDataSource::open("elevation.tif")?;
let reader = GeoTiffReader::open(source)?;
println!("Size  : {}x{}", reader.width(), reader.height());
println!("Bands : {}", reader.band_count());

// COG tile access (HTTP range requests supported transparently)
let tile = reader.read_tile(0, 0, 0)?;
```

### Vector layers (Shapefile / GeoJSON / GeoPackage)

```rust
use oxigeo::Dataset;

// GeoPackage needs the (non-default) `gpkg` feature; .shp and .geojson are on
// by default.
let dataset = Dataset::open("cities.gpkg")?;
println!("layers  : {}", dataset.layer_count());

let layer = dataset.layer(0)?;                  // or .layer_by_name("cities")
println!("{} ({:?}), {:?} features, fields {:?}",
         layer.name(), layer.geometry_type(), layer.feature_count(),
         layer.field_names());

for feature in layer.features()? {
    // feature.geometry: Option<oxigeo::Geometry>
    // feature.properties: HashMap<String, oxigeo::FieldValue>
    println!("{:?} — {:?}", feature.geometry, feature.properties);
}
```

### CRS Transformation

```rust
use oxigeo_proj::{Coordinate, Crs, Transformer};

let wgs84  = Crs::from_epsg(4326)?;
let utm54n = Crs::from_epsg(32654)?;   // UTM Zone 54N (Japan)
let tf     = Transformer::new(wgs84, utm54n)?;   // takes ownership of both CRS

let tokyo = Coordinate::from_lon_lat(139.7671, 35.6812);
let utm   = tf.transform(&tokyo)?;
println!("{:.2}, {:.2}", utm.x, utm.y);

// SIMD-vectorized batch transform (Transverse Mercator / Mercator / LCC
// projections get a dedicated SIMD kernel; other projections fall back to
// scalar per-point transformation)
let points = vec![tokyo; 1_000_000];
let batch  = tf.transform_batch(&points)?;

// Reuse a cached, thread-safe Transformer across many calls instead of
// rebuilding the PROJ pipeline every time:
use oxigeo_proj::TransformerCache;
let cache   = TransformerCache::new(16);
let cached  = cache.get_or_build(4326, 32654)?;
let utm2    = cached.transform(&tokyo)?;
```

### Raster Algorithms

```rust
use oxigeo_algorithms::raster::{hillshade, HillshadeParams};
use oxigeo_algorithms::{Resampler, ResamplingMethod};

// SIMD hillshade (AVX2 / NEON auto-selected at runtime)
let shaded = hillshade(&dem, HillshadeParams::standard())?;

// SIMD-accelerated resampling (nearest / bilinear / bicubic / lanczos)
let resized = Resampler::new(ResamplingMethod::Bilinear).resample(&dem, 512, 512)?;

// Full CRS reprojection combines a `Transformer` (oxigeo-proj, per-pixel
// coordinate mapping) with a `Resampler` — see `oxigeo-cli`'s `warp`
// command (crates/oxigeo-cli/src/commands/warp.rs) for the reference
// implementation, or invoke it directly: `oxigeo warp --t-srs EPSG:32654 in.tif out.tif`
```

### GeoParquet (Arrow)

```rust
use oxigeo_core::types::BoundingBox;
use oxigeo_geoparquet::GeoParquetReader;

let mut reader = GeoParquetReader::open("buildings.parquet")?;
let bbox       = BoundingBox::new(135.0, 34.0, 137.0, 36.0)?;

// Row-group pruning via the spatial index, then an exact per-row bbox check
let batches = reader.read_filtered_exact(bbox)?;
```

### Python Bindings

```python
import oxigeo

ds   = oxigeo.open("satellite.tif")     # mode="r" by default
data = ds.read_band(1)                   # returns a NumPy ndarray
meta = ds.get_metadata()
print(f"Size: {meta['width']}x{meta['height']}")

result = oxigeo.calc("A * 2", A=data)   # raster algebra
oxigeo.write("output.tif", result, metadata=meta)
```

### WebAssembly

```javascript
import init, { WasmCogViewer } from '@cooljapan/oxigeo';
await init();

const viewer = new WasmCogViewer();
await viewer.open('https://example.com/cog.tif');

const imageData = await viewer.read_tile_as_image_data(0, 0, 0);
ctx.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);
```

### CLI

```bash
oxigeo info world.tif
oxigeo convert input.shp output.fgb
oxigeo dem hillshade elevation.tif hillshade.tif --azimuth 315 --altitude 45
oxigeo warp --t-srs EPSG:32654 input.tif output.tif
```

## Enterprise Features

### Security (`oxigeo-security`, `oxigeo-gateway`)

- Encryption at rest: AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Password hashing: Argon2id
- Transport: TLS 1.3 via `rustls` (no OpenSSL)
- Authentication: JWT, OAuth2
- Authorization: RBAC and ABAC
- Audit logging: SOC2 and GDPR-ready
- Message integrity: HMAC-SHA256
- All crypto: pure Rust (`ring`, `rustls`, `aes-gcm`, `chacha20poly1305`, `argon2`)

### High Availability (`oxigeo-ha`, `oxigeo-cluster`)

- Raft consensus-based cluster coordination
- Automatic failover and leader election
- Distributed partitioning and sharding (`oxigeo-distributed`)
- Multi-tier cache: in-memory LRU -> on-disk -> Redis (`oxigeo-cache-advanced`)
- CRDT-based offline sync with Merkle tree verification (`oxigeo-sync`)

### Streaming & Messaging

| Crate | Integration |
|-------|-------------|
| `oxigeo-streaming` | Real-time stream processing |
| `oxigeo-kafka` | Apache Kafka — **RETIRED in 0.2.1**, no further releases ([why](#retired-crates)) |
| `oxigeo-kinesis` | AWS Kinesis |
| `oxigeo-pubsub` | Google Pub/Sub |
| `oxigeo-mqtt` | MQTT / IoT |
| `oxigeo-websocket` | WebSocket real-time |

### OGC Services (`oxigeo-server`)

- WMS 1.3.0 tile server
- WFS 2.0.0 feature service
- API gateway with JWT auth and rate limiting

## Retired Crates

| Crate | Retired | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `oxigeo-kafka` | 0.2.1 | No further releases; crates.io 0.0.1 and 0.2.0 yanked |

**`oxigeo-kafka` (Apache Kafka integration) was retired in 0.2.1** and will receive no
further releases. It was the only crate in the workspace that made a C toolchain
mandatory — `rdkafka-sys` builds librdkafka through `cmake` — which stands against the
COOLJAPAN Pure Rust Policy, and it had no consumers anywhere inside the workspace.
With it removed, `cargo check --workspace --all-features` no longer needs `cmake`.
The `kafka` features of `oxigeo-etl` and `oxigeo-workflow` were removed at the same
time. For messaging, use `oxigeo-streaming`, `oxigeo-kinesis`, `oxigeo-pubsub`, or
`oxigeo-mqtt`; to talk to Kafka specifically, use a Kafka client directly in your own
code. Workflow definitions can still describe Kafka endpoints via the pure-Rust
`IntegrationType::Kafka` / `MessageQueueType::Kafka` metadata enums in
`oxigeo-workflow`.

| **v0.2.4** | 2026-08-18 (release-ready) | Correctness release: browser COG URL path works end to end for the first time (`buffered_source` sync-over-fetch driver — one `HEAD` plus one range request to open a normally laid-out COG), GDAL internal-mask IFDs excluded from overview levels consistently across `oxigeo-geotiff`/`oxigeo-wasm` (level indexing, tile geometry and pyramid metadata all agree), `readTile` honours its `level` argument; `oxigeo-proj` feature matrix verified (`no_std` via a new `libm`-backed math shim, `proj-db` implies `std`, `proj4rs-compat` compiles), `proj-db` no longer changes transform results (feature-invariant CRS resolution on OxiProj 0.1.5), SIMD batch fast path gated to configurations it reproduces faithfully, embedded EPSG registry corrected (US State Plane ft/us-ft native units, JGD2011 Plane Rectangular I–XIX + UTM 6688–6692); GeoPackage overflow-page cells (#17) and REAL-affinity typed scans; VRT fractional `SrcRect`/`DstRect` parsing (#18) and mosaic nodata-skip compositing (#19); GeoParquet null-preserving readers, encoding dispatch and `from_bytes`; `quick-xml` → `oxixml-quickxml-compat`; 75 crates |
