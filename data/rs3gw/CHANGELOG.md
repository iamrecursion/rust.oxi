# Changelog

All notable changes to rs3gw will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.3] - Unreleased

### Added

### Changed

- `quick-xml` dependency renamed to the pure-Rust `oxixml-quickxml-compat` (COOLJAPAN policy), pinned via `package = "oxixml-quickxml-compat", version = "0.1.1"` in `[workspace.dependencies]`; the `serialize` feature and all existing `quick-xml` usage sites (`src/api/xml_responses/*`, `src/api/handlers/functions/select_parser.rs`) are unaffected — drop-in API compatible.

### Fixed

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- New `server` Cargo feature (default-on) gating the HTTP/gRPC server stack (axum, axum-server, tonic, async-graphql, utoipa, metrics-exporter-prometheus, opentelemetry/OTLP, reqwest webhooks). Library consumers can now use `default-features = false, features = ["local"]` to depend on only the storage layer.
- New `local` Cargo feature for the storage-only profile.
- Feature-gated cloud backends: `s3` (aws-sdk-s3 + aws-config), `gcs` (google-cloud-*), `azure` (azure_*), and `formats` (parquet/arrow/apache-avro/orc-rust/prost-reflect/rmp-serde). All off by default. New `all-backends` meta-feature activates all four.
- `UsageTracker` (`src/observability/usage.rs`) — in-memory per-bucket accumulator tracking PUT/GET/DELETE request counts, bytes uploaded/downloaded, and live storage size/object count; drives the new `/api/usage` and `/api/usage/{bucket}` REST endpoints.
- `/api/usage` endpoint — returns a JSON report with per-bucket `storage_bytes`, `object_count`, `bytes_uploaded`, `bytes_downloaded`, `requests_by_op`, `total_requests`, `estimated_cost.total_usd`, plus report-level `total_objects`, `total_storage_bytes`, and `generated_at`. Accepts `?flush=true` to invoke registered cost-hook callbacks.
- `usage_tests.rs` — 2 integration tests exercising the full `/api/usage` report and `?flush=true` hook path against real S3 operations.
- `xml_parser_fuzz.rs` — deterministic fuzz harness (3 tests) for the hand-rolled XML request parsers; uses a seeded xorshift64\* PRNG so any failure reproduces identically across runs.
- Soak and observability integration test suites (`soak_tests.rs`, `observability_tests.rs`) for latency exemplars per v0.3/v0.5 roadmap.
- `protox = "0.9"` build dependency — pure-Rust `.proto` compiler; `build.rs` now calls `protox::compile` to produce a `FileDescriptorSet` consumed by `tonic-prost-build`, eliminating the need for a system `protoc` installation.

### Changed
- `scirs2-core` and `scirs2-io` updated from 0.4.4 to 0.5.0.
- `oxiarc-zstd`, `oxiarc-lz4`, `oxiarc-deflate` updated from 0.2.8 to 0.3.3.
- `opentelemetry-otlp` now uses `default-features = false` (grpc-tonic transport only) to drop the reqwest/native-tls HTTP path.
- `tonic` dependency now includes `features = ["tls-ring"]` for TLS support.
- All server-only integration test files now carry `#![cfg(feature = "server")]`; format-dependent modules carry `#[cfg(feature = "formats")]` guards — compilation is skipped cleanly when the relevant feature is off.
- `select_object_content` handler and XML select parser gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "formats")]`.
- Binary `testdata-generator` now declares `required-features = ["formats"]`; `s3-migrate` requires `["s3", "server"]`; `rs3ctl` requires `["server"]`.
- Pure-Rust default closure: with `default-features = false, features = ["local"]`, the dependency tree no longer pulls `ring`, `aws-lc-sys`, `native-tls`, `zstd-sys`, or `rustls 0.23` (C/FFI eliminated for the storage-only profile, per COOLJAPAN Pure Rust Policy).

### Fixed
- `HEAD` for SSE-encrypted objects now returns the plaintext `Content-Length` instead of the on-disk ciphertext length, making it consistent with `GET`; the sidecar is loaded to derive the plaintext size from either the sum of per-chunk `plaintext_len` fields (chunked/multipart) or `single_shot_plaintext_len(ciphertext_len)` (single-PUT), with a best-effort fallback to the on-disk size if the sidecar is unavailable.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- Comprehensive tests for S3 Object Lock, RestoreObject, and SSE operations (961 tests total)

### Changed
- Update dependencies: quick-xml 0.40, parquet/arrow 58.x, azure_core 1.0
- Reintroduce integration smoke test workflow (`.disabled`)

### Fixed
- Resolve OpenTelemetry version conflict: downgrade `opentelemetry*` from 0.32 to 0.31 to align with `tracing-opentelemetry` 0.32.x which internally targets opentelemetry 0.31.x

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16
