//! The writer's object model: a tree of groups, and the paths that navigate it.
//!
//! An HDF5 group is a recursive structure, and this module models it as one.
//! [`GroupNode`] holds datasets, sub-groups **and** attributes; the root group
//! is an ordinary node that happens to be nameless and pinned to a fixed
//! address, so it is planned and emitted by the same code as every other group
//! rather than by a parallel set of special cases.
//!
//! Every public entry point that takes a path resolves it here, through
//! [`split_path`] and [`group_mut`].  That matters twice over:
//!
//! * There is one definition of what a path *means*.  The five
//!   `name.contains('/')` rejections this replaced were five slightly different
//!   definitions of a name, none of which admitted a nested group.
//! * There is one definition of whether a name is *free* — [`name_taken`],
//!   which asks about datasets and sub-groups together.  Three of the old
//!   insertion points asked only about datasets, so a dataset could shadow a
//!   group: two links with the same name in one symbol table, which the format
//!   cannot represent and the reader resolves by whichever it meets first.
