//! Chunk geometry, and the B-tree v1 type-1 index that addresses it.
//!
//! Two things live here because they are the same question asked twice: *where
//! does chunk `i` start* decides both the layout message's chunk-dimension
//! vector and the key the B-tree files that chunk under, and the two have to
//! agree or libhdf5 looks for a chunk that is not there.
//!
//! # Node width is not negotiable
//!
//! A B-tree v1 node is read as a fixed-size image whose length libhdf5 computes
//! *before* it has seen the node:
//!
//! ```text
//! sizeof_rnode = 24 + two_k * 8 + (two_k + 1) * sizeof_rkey
//! ```
//!
//! `two_k` is `2 × btree_k[H5B_CHUNK]`, and for a superblock v0 or v1 file that
//! `K` is not read from the file at all — it is `HDF5_BTREE_CHUNK_IK_DEF`, a
//! compile-time **32**.  Those superblocks carry `leaf_node_K` (bytes 16..18)
//! and the *group* B-tree's `internal_node_K` (bytes 18..20), and nothing that
//! describes this tree.  So every chunk B-tree node in a file we write must be
//! [`chunk_node_size`] bytes wide however few chunks it holds, with the slots
//! past `entries_used` zero-filled.
//!
//! Sizing a node for its contents instead is what produced
//! `addr overflow, addr = 3000, size = 2096, eoa = 3112`: an 80-byte node for a
//! one-dimensional dataset, asked for as 2096 bytes, running off the end of the
//! file.  The 2096 in that message is exactly `chunk_node_size(1)`, which is how
//! the constant below was confirmed rather than guessed.
