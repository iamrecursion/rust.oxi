//! Communication and digital effects module.
//!
//! Provides signal-processing primitives that arise in networked and
//! digital control systems:
//!
//! - [`quantizer`]: uniform, logarithmic, and dynamic (zoom) quantizers.
//! - [`packet_dropout`]: Bernoulli and Markov packet-dropout models with ZOH.
//! - [`time_delay`]: fixed ring-buffer delay and Padé delay approximation.
