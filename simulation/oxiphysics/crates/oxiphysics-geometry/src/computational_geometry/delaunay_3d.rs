//! Exact 3-D Delaunay tetrahedralization (Bowyer-Watson) and α-shape extraction.
//!
//! This module builds the Delaunay tetrahedralization of a 3-D point set with an
//! *incremental* Bowyer-Watson insertion driven entirely by the exact predicates
//! from [`oxiphysics_core::exact_predicates`]:
//!
//! * [`orient3d`] decides on which side of an oriented triangle a point lies. It
//!   is used both to keep every tetrahedron consistently positively oriented and
//!   to drive the walk-based point-location step.
//! * [`insphere`] is the empty-sphere oracle: for a positively oriented tet
//!   `(a,b,c,d)` it reports whether a query point `p` lies strictly inside, on, or
//!   outside the tet's circumsphere. A point inside the circumsphere makes the tet
//!   *non-Delaunay* with respect to `p`, so the tet enters the insertion cavity.
//!
//! Both predicates run Shewchuk's adaptive floating-point filter and fall back to
//! exact expansion arithmetic only in the degenerate band, so the reported signs
//! are always provably correct. Genuine ties (`Orientation::Degenerate` — five
//! cospherical points, or four coplanar points) are broken with a
//! Simulation-of-Simplicity (SoS) rule keyed on the *lowest global vertex index*
//! among the points involved, exactly mirroring the `sos_sign` convention already
//! used by `mesh_boolean`. Because that rule depends only on the order-independent
//! set of indices, the same geometric configuration always resolves the same way,
//! giving a consistent virtual general position with no robustness failures.
//!
//! ## Algorithm (Bowyer-Watson, incremental)
//!
//! First a *super-tetrahedron* far larger than the input AABB is created so that
//! every input point lies strictly inside it (its four vertices receive sentinel
//! indices `n, n+1, n+2, n+3` appended after the `n` user points).
//!
//! Then each input point `p` is inserted in turn via four sub-steps. *Walk-based
//! location* starts from the most recently created tet and hops across the face
//! whose plane separates the current tet from `p` until the containing tet is
//! reached (with a brute-force fallback guarding against any degenerate walk cycle).
//! *Cavity identification* floods the face-adjacency graph to collect every tet
//! whose circumsphere contains `p` (`insphere`, with SoS on cospherical ties). The
//! *cavity boundary* — the faces shared by exactly one cavity tet — forms a
//! star-shaped polyhedron around `p`. Finally *re-tetrahedralization* joins `p` to
//! every boundary face, rebuilding the face-adjacency (`neigh`) of the new tets, of
//! each other, and of the outer tets bordering the cavity.
//!
//! When all points are inserted, every tet incident to a super-tetrahedron vertex is
//! removed, leaving the Delaunay tetrahedralization of the original `n` points.
//!
//! ## α-shapes
//!
//! [`Tetrahedralization::alpha_shape`] extracts the boundary of the α-complex at a
//! squared filtration radius `alpha`: a triangular face lies on the α-shape when it
//! is incident to exactly one Delaunay tet whose squared circumradius is `≤ alpha`.
//! At a sufficiently large `alpha` this reproduces the convex-hull boundary of the
//! point set; at smaller `alpha` it carves concavities, recovering, e.g., the
//! surface of a sampled sphere as a closed orientable mesh.
//!
