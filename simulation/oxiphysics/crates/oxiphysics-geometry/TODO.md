# oxiphysics-geometry TODO

**Version:** 0.1.3 | **Updated:** 2026-06-11 | **Status:** v0.1.x complete — production baseline; forward roadmap active
**Scale:** 85,006 SLoC | 3,120 tests

Geometry kernel of the OxiPhysics workspace: primitive shapes, triangle meshes
and the full mesh-processing pipeline, computational geometry, parametric and
implicit surfaces, procedural generation. The forward roadmap below is
code-verified (2026-06-11) and focuses on exact-arithmetic robustness, 3D
meshing, advanced surface operations, and analysis-suitable (IGA-ready)
geometry — all pure Rust.

**Cross-crate contract** — dependencies and consumers of this roadmap:
- Exact-arithmetic robust booleans (v0.2.0) consume `oxiphysics-core`'s Shewchuk adaptive predicates (core v0.2.0); the same core predicates also serve `oxiphysics-collision` narrow-phase robustness. Sequence the boolean rebuild after core lands them.
- Convex decomposition (VHACD shipped; CoACD-style v2 at v1.0) supplies collision proxies consumed by `oxiphysics-collision`.
- T-spline / subdivision-limit evaluation (v1.0) feeds `oxiphysics-fem`'s isogeometric-analysis upgrade (fem v0.3.0).

## v0.2.0 — Robustness & meshing

- [x] Exact-arithmetic robust booleans — degenerate-band delivered 2026-06-12
  - **Files:** mesh_boolean.rs (degenerate-band sidedness routed through `oxiphysics_core::exact_predicates::orient3d`)
  - **Tests:** coincident-cube Union/Difference watertight + Euler V−E+F=2; 1000 near-degenerate booleans (cube∩cube rotated + cube∩octahedron) zero panic/NaN, finite tri counts; volume identity |A∪B|=|A|+|B|−|A∩B| on a clean overlap
  - **Risk (resolved):** the winding-number core did resist full exact threading, so a focused exact-classify helper handles the degenerate band while keeping the `SimpleMesh`/`mesh_boolean` API stable.
  - **Goal (met for coincident faces):** boolean of two coincident-face cubes yields a watertight manifold (Union & Difference, Euler=2); 1000 near-degenerate booleans, 0 failures.
  - **Design:** consumes core Shewchuk `orient3d` + Simulation-of-Simplicity (parity-of-lowest-index tie-break) in `mesh_boolean`. Shewchuk 1997; Edelsbrunner-Mücke SoS.
  - Delivered: exact ray-parity point-in-mesh (`exact_classify_point_vs_mesh`), exact ray–triangle crossing (`exact_ray_crosses_triangle` via 5 `orient3d` tests), SoS tie-break (`sos_sign`), coincident-face router (`TriClass`/`classify_triangle_exact`/`keep_triangle`); `mesh_boolean` now classifies via the exact, coincident-face-aware path. File 1952 lines (<2000); clippy clean (-D warnings); no `#[allow]`; no production unwrap.
  - [x] Replace float orientation/intersection sign tests with core `orient3d`-family predicates (centroid sidedness + coincident-face plane tests now exact)
  - [x] Simulation-of-simplicity (SoS) symbolic perturbation to eliminate degenerate branches (`sos_sign`: degenerate `orient3d` → parity of lowest global vertex index, order-independent → consistent virtual general position)
  - [x] Exact face classification (inside/outside/on-boundary) via `classify_triangle_exact` → `TriClass{Inside,Outside,CoplanarSame,CoplanarOpposite}`
  - [x] Watertight coincident-face result with manifoldness post-conditions (Union & Difference: `is_watertight` + Euler=2 asserted)
  - [x] Stress corpus: 1000 near-degenerate booleans (coincident faces, near-coincident rotated/translated), 0 failures; coincident-cube watertight gate
  - [ ] full-BSP exact booleans (intersection-curve re-triangulation; the degenerate-band classifier shipped now makes coincident-FACE booleans watertight via orient3d+SoS, but arbitrary mid-triangle intersections still need a BSP/CDT rebuild for guaranteed manifoldness and an exact triangle-triangle intersection segment). Boundary: whole-triangle centroid selection cannot re-triangulate where a face is pierced through its interior, so the volume identity holds only to a whole-triangle-selection tolerance there and Intersection of face-touching solids is the zero-volume degenerate case (correctly removed).

- [x] 3D Delaunay + constrained Delaunay + alpha shapes (delivered 2026-06-12; CDT facet recovery deferred — see sub-item)
  - **Goal:** tetrahedralize 10⁴ points with empty-sphere property holding for all tets; α-shape recovers known surface.
  - **Files:** `computational_geometry/delaunay_3d.rs` (new, ~1440 L < 2000); wired through `computational_geometry/mod.rs` + `lib.rs` (`pub use computational_geometry::delaunay_3d`).
  - **Design:** incremental Bowyer-Watson 3D + star-shaped-cavity repair + α-complex. Edelsbrunner-Mücke 1994; Bowyer/Watson 1981; predicates Shewchuk 1997; SoS Edelsbrunner-Mücke 1990.
  - Verified: `computational_geometry` has 2D `delaunay_2d` + `voronoi_from_delaunay` (see Completed); 3D + α now delivered, CDT still open.
  - Depends on: core exact `insphere` predicate for robust empty-sphere tests (consumed via `oxiphysics_core::exact_predicates::{insphere, orient3d}`).
  - Delivered: exact Bowyer-Watson driven by core `orient3d`/`insphere`; every tet kept positively oriented; all degeneracies (cospherical/coplanar/grid) resolved by parity-of-lowest-index SoS (matching `mesh_boolean::sos_sign`); walk-based point location with brute-force fallback; circumsphere flood + **star-shaped-cavity repair** (face-visibility test that absorbs non-visible neighbours, guaranteeing the refill is gap/overlap-free — this was the key to correct volumes under cospherical degeneracy); full face-adjacency (`neigh`) rebuild; super-tetra strip + compaction. `Tetrahedralization::{circumradius_sq, alpha_shape, verify_empty_sphere}`. Tests: single-tet, bipyramid 2-tet known case, cube (8 cospherical corners, volume==1), random 400/1000-pt empty-sphere audits (default-run) + env-gated 10⁴-pt audit, α-shape closed-surface (sphere cloud + convex hull, every edge twice), α=0 empty, duplicate tolerance. clippy `-D warnings` clean; no `#[allow]`; no production `unwrap()`.
  - [x] Incremental Bowyer-Watson 3D with walk-based point location
  - [x] Cavity retriangulation + degenerate-input handling via exact predicates
  - [ ] Constrained Delaunay: boundary facet recovery — follow-on; unconstrained Delaunay + α-shapes shipped now, but enforcing prescribed boundary facets (Steiner-point insertion / facet recovery) is a distinct effort filed for a later pass.
  - [x] α-complex filtration + α-shape extraction with known-surface recovery test
  - [x] Empty-sphere audit over every tet of a 10⁴-point tetrahedralization (`verify_empty_sphere`; `random_cloud_10k_empty_sphere_audit`, env-gated `OXIPHYSICS_DELAUNAY_10K`)

- [ ] ABF++ parameterization + LSCM v2
  - **Goal:** disk-topology mesh UV area distortion < 5% vs current simplified LSCM.
  - **Design:** angle-based flattening with proper sparse solve. Sheffer 2005.
  - Verified: `mesh_param.rs` has simplified LSCM + Tutte (see Completed); ABF is missing.
  - [ ] ABF++ angle-space optimization (Newton on the Lagrangian with sparse linear solves)
  - [ ] Angle-to-UV reconstruction (least-squares layout)
  - [ ] LSCM v2 with a proper sparse least-squares solve replacing the simplified path

  - **Design:** wavefront-propagation straight skeleton + convolution Minkowski sum. Aichholzer 1996.

  - **Goal:** MMP distance matches analytic on unfolded cube to 1e-9.
  - **Design:** Mitchell-Mount-Papadimitriou exact polyhedral geodesics. Mitchell 1987.
  - Verified: `geodesic/` Dijkstra + `geodesic_geometry` heat method already ship (see Completed) — exact MMP is the only open part.
  - [ ] Edge-window data structure + window propagation queue
  - [ ] Window trimming/merging with exact unfolding arithmetic
  - [ ] Distance-field extraction + geodesic path backtracing
  - [ ] Unfolded-cube analytic validation to 1e-9; cross-check against the heat-method approximation

- [ ] Quad-dominant remeshing (cross-field)
  - **Goal:** quad-dominant remesh with >85% quads, singularities only at field defects.
  - **Design:** instant-meshes-style cross-field + position-field optimization. Jakob 2015.
  - Verified: `remesh.rs` is triangle remeshing; the quad path is missing.
  - [ ] 4-RoSy cross-field smoothing (hierarchical/extrinsic)
  - [ ] Position-field optimization aligned to the cross-field
  - [ ] Quad extraction + T-vertex cleanup
  - [ ] Metrics gate: >85% quad ratio, singularities only at field defects

- [~] (planned 2026-06-14) Jump-flooding SDF + screened-Poisson reconstruction
  - **Goal:** JFA SDF within 1 voxel of exact; Poisson recon reproduces sphere to <1% radius error.
  - **Design:** JFA voxel SDF + Kazhdan screened-Poisson surface reconstruction from oriented points. Rong-Tan 2006; Kazhdan-Hoppe 2013.
  - Verified: `signed_distance_field/fmm.rs` + `octree.rs` already ship (see Completed) — JFA + Poisson reconstruction are the open parts.
  - [ ] JFA seed injection + 1+JFA flood passes on a voxel grid
  - [ ] Sign resolution + accuracy audit (≤ 1 voxel vs exact SDF)
  - [ ] Screened-Poisson: octree-discretized Laplacian, normal-field divergence RHS, screening term

  - **Design:** QEM extended to preserve UV/normals/seams + mesh-quality validation harness. Garland-Heckbert 1998 (attributes).

  - **Design:** analysis-suitable T-splines + watertight subdivision limit evaluation feeding FEM IGA. Sederberg 2003; Scott 2012.
