//! Exact (adaptive-filter) geometric predicates for robust computational geometry.
//!
//! This module implements the orientation and in-sphere/in-circle predicates that
//! underpin Delaunay triangulation, convex-hull construction, and mesh generation.
//! Each predicate first evaluates a cheap `f64` *fast filter* together with a
//! conservative forward-error bound; only when the floating-point determinant is
//! too close to zero to trust the sign does the code fall back to an *exact*
//! evaluation carried out in arbitrary-precision floating-point *expansions*. The
//! exact path is therefore taken rarely, yet the reported sign is always provably
//! correct -- there are no robustness failures, no spurious degeneracies, and no
//! inconsistent answers across permutations of the inputs.
//!
//! The expansion arithmetic (multi-term nonoverlapping `f64` sequences, the
//! `grow`/`scale`/`fast-expansion-sum` operations, and the zero-elimination
//! variants used here) and the adaptive-filtering strategy follow:
//!
//! * Jonathan Richard Shewchuk, "Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and
//!   Fast Robust Geometric Predicates", Discrete & Computational Geometry
//!   18(3):305-363, 1997.
//!
//! All exact arithmetic is built from the error-free transforms in
//! [`crate::extended_precision`] ([`two_sum`], [`two_prod`], [`fast_two_sum`], and
//! a local two-difference transform). **No fused multiply-add (FMA) is used
//! anywhere**, so every result is bit-for-bit deterministic across platforms.
//!
//! The stage-A error-bound constants are those derived in Shewchuk §4. When the
//! fast filter cannot certify the sign, each predicate enters the adaptive
//! refinement of Shewchuk §4-5 (implemented in the sibling [`adapt`] module): an
//! incremental stage-B expansion of the rounded-difference determinant tested
//! against a stage-B bound, followed by a first-order tail correction tested
//! against the result bound. Only when *both* incremental stages remain uncertain
//! does the predicate fall through to the fully exact expansion, which is the
//! final authority for the sign. The adaptive path therefore always returns
//! exactly the same sign as the exact expansion -- it is merely faster on the
//! easy near-degenerate cases, never less correct.
