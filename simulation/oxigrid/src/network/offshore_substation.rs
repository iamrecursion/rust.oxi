//! Offshore substation design and optimization module for offshore wind farm electrical systems.
//!
//! This module provides tools for designing the complete electrical infrastructure
//! of offshore wind farms, including:
//! - Collector array design (MV cable systems at 33 kV or 66 kV)
//! - Offshore substation platform selection and sizing
//! - Export cable technology selection (HVAC vs HVDC)
//! - Loss computation and LCOE estimation
//! - HVAC vs HVDC system comparison
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//! The module implements industry-standard heuristics and engineering formulas
//! used in offshore wind farm electrical system design, following IEC 61400-1,
//! CIGRE guidelines, and common practice from North Sea project data.
