//! Black Start Procedure Planning and Simulation
//!
//! This module implements a full black start (BS) capability assessment,
//! cranking-path discovery, restoration sequencing, and time-domain
//! simulation of the island-building process following a total blackout.
//!
//! # Key concepts
//! - **Black-start unit** — a generator that can self-energise without
//!   external grid power (hydro, diesel, battery-backed, etc.)
//! - **Cranking path** — the sequence of transmission branches that must
//!   be energised to deliver cranking power from a BS unit to a non-BS
//!   generator.
//! - **Power island** — an isolated sub-network that is being restored
//!   independently before merging with neighbouring islands.
//! - **Cold load pickup (CLPU)** — the inrush that occurs when load is
//!   restored after a cold outage; modelled as a multiplier on nominal MW.
//!
//! # Algorithm overview
//! 1. Identify all BS-capable generators.
//! 2. For each BS unit, BFS the branch graph to find shortest cranking
//!    paths to non-BS generators.
//! 3. Build a step-by-step restoration plan, respecting generation
//!    headroom and CLPU frequency constraints.
//! 4. Simulate execution of the plan, tracking frequency nadir and
//!    voltage violations at each load-pickup event.
